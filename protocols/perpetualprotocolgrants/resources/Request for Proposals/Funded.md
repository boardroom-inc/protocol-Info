# Funded RFPs

RFPs (or Request for Proposals) are items that we'd love for someone in the community to build.

- **RFP 1:** User Analytics tools
  There's loads that can be covered here from PnL analysis, to seeing historical funding charts all the way down to PnL by Token by Wallet

- **RFP 4:** Video Courses for Perpetual Trading
  Create a series of videos to explain how to trade perpetual futures and use [https://perp.exchange](perp.exchange) as the platform of choice in the video. The benchmark for this RFP would be the [option courses](https://insights.deribit.com/options-course/) on Deribit.
