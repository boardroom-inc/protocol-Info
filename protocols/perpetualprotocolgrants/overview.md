# Program Details

Given one of the main goals of the Perpetual Protocol is to become the base layer for other protocols to build on top of it, one main ways to foster this is to encourage & support builders to build on top of the Perpetual protocol using a grants system.
There is currently 2M USD in PERP that is allocated to funding grants. This program will start in August 2021 and run for 2 quarters. This program will cover 2 main items:

1. Request for Proposals (RFPs): these are items that the core team would like to be built or done but currently don't have bandwidth for. If you want some ideas on places or items to help with this is a good place to start!
2. Grants: these are all of your weird and wonderful ideas that we could never think of! If you have anything that you believe falls under the grants categories then reach out to us

## Process

Depending on the amount that you are looking for we have a rough process of what this looks like:

- <$50K - full discretion of the committee
- \>$50K - requires going to the public forum
- RFPs - the price is set by the committee at the start

### Committee
