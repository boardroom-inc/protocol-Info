The Index Coop is the first community-led decentralized organization focused on enabling the creation and adoption of crypto index primitives. Its primary product, the Defi Pulse Index (DPI), comprises a broadly diversified pool of governance tokens which is rebalanced monthly based on market capitalization. It’s on its way to becoming a global DeFi community launching and maintaining the world’s best crypto index vehicles - the following is an overview of its governance process, powered by the Index token:

#### Index Improvement Proposals
An IIP is a proposal to update some function or standard within the Index Coop. IIPs can vary widely from proposing new Index products, to requesting funds from the Index Treasury, to performing Index Coop smart contract upgrades. The IIP proposal process largely follows the same behavior as Ethereum's EIP process.

#### Meta-Governance
Meta-governance refers to the ability for $INDEX token holders to vote on governance proposals for other protocols. Governance tokens held within the $DPI index can be used to vote on their respective proposals. Currently this is limited to Uniswap, Compound and AAVE. You can head to our meta voting page if you hold $INDEX to check for open proposals and cast your vote!
