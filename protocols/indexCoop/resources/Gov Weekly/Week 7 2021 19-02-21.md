Decision Gate 2 is the final vote for onboarding products to the Index Coop. A passing vote here signals commitment by the Index Coop to launch the Flexible Leverage Index in a timely manner. Pulse Inc would like to propose that the Index Coop manage a series of Sets based on a new Index called Flexible Leverage Index (FLI). FLI lets you leverage a collateralized debt without having to manage a collateralized debt, by abstracting collateralized debt management into a simple index, reproducible by an ERC20 token built on [Set Protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/).

| IIP-15: Metaverse Index | Development | [Discuss](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-15-metaverse-index/837) |

This IIP relates to launching the Metaverse Index with an updated methodology as described below. This will be the first index product to be launched from within the Coop community and not with an external partner as the methodologist. It is designed to capture the potential upside of the new but growing group of projects on Ethereum that relate to virtual ownership through NFTs, gaming, virtual reality and entertainment.  
The opportunity here is to create an index that rewards long term investment in a decentralized and virtual future.
