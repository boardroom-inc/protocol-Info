| Decision Gate 1: Metaverse Index (MVI) | Meta | [Vote](https://app.boardroom.info/index/poll/Qmeaho3rEC8pM9t3FwhCQ86rdYtrpo2iDqHSxMcf2nu51Z) |

Decision Gate 1 is the initial vote for onboarding products to the Index Coop. A passing vote here signals interest by the Index Coop to explore the feasibility of launching the Metaverse Index product. Index would like to propose the first "in house" index run and managed by the community. MVI lets users gain exposure to the new but growing group of projects on Ethereum that relate to virtual ownership through NFTs, gaming, virtual reality, entertainment platforms and more in one convenient ERC20 token built on [Set Protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/).

Update: The proposal passed on Feb 27th and will now move on to a decision gate 2 after work and research is carried out to assign MVI a product prioritization score.
