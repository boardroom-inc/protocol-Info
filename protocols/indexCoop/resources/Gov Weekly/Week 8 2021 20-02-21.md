Decision Gate 2 is the final vote for onboarding products to the Index Coop. A passing vote here signals commitment to launch the Flexible Leverage Index in a timely manner. Pulse Inc would like to propose that the Index Coop manage a series of Sets based on a new Index called Flexible Leverage Index (FLI). FLI lets users leverage a collateralized debt without having to manage a collateralized debt, by abstracting collateralized debt management into a simple index, reproducible by an ERC20 token built on Set Protocol.

Update: The proposal passed on Feb 22nd and will now move on to the construction stage.
