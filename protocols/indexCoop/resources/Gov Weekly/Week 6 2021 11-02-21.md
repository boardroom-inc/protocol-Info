| Decision Gate 2: Flexible Leverage Index (FLI) | Development | [View](https://app.boardroom.info/index/poll/QmQwQn4k324kMKPjsSX6ZEzjkkKWh1DNfAN2mQ3dd5aP1a) |

Decision Gate 2 is the final vote for onboarding products to the Index Coop. A passing vote here signals commitment by the Index Coop to launch the Flexible Leverage Index in a timely manner. Pulse Inc would like to propose that the Index Coop manage a series of Sets based on a new Index called Flexible Leverage Index (FLI). FLI lets you leverage a collateralized debt without having to manage a collateralized debt, by abstracting collateralized debt management into a simple index, reproducible by an ERC20 token built on [Set Protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/).
