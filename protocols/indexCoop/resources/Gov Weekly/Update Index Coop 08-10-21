## Summary

A vote on the voting process for the Meta-Governance Committee (MGC) will be queued for October 11; no other votes are currently anticipated.

This past week we had the passing of [IIP-90](https://snapshot.org/#/index-coop.eth/proposal/QmYPKh6oy2YeCtutxtNmSxUQwUaztADJur8YypQn4VGTTp) to deprecate the Funding Council wallet and roll those operational aspects up to the Operations Account.  We also had the passing of two DG1 votes; DG indicating 'Decision Gate' and '1' indicating that it is the first of a two-part voting process whereby new index products are launched.  DG1 votes have no quorum, provide an early indication of product interest by the community, and initiate further analysis by the Product and Engineering teams.  The passing DG1 votes are for the NFT Blue Chip Index [JPG](https://snapshot.org/#/index-coop.eth/proposal/QmXvqAyhiachqJdVNVaFCv8vEGXovjJuQhhA1kbsDiBNbs) and the Polygon Diversified Index [PDI](https://snapshot.org/#/index-coop.eth/proposal/QmcXEdcHLCHByzJ6n4EzzQAH3bcEBfiAAnb6pfhbNESgpK).

Meta-Governance is one of the main use-cases of the INDEX token, and we had three meta-governance votes this week, they can be found here: [COMPOUND-63](https://snapshot.org/#/index-coop.eth/proposal/QmbNMSzTBrUDzTFymFZTmZHGA94RU397KLobvvqVydhcat), [COMPOUND-64](https://snapshot.org/#/index-coop.eth/proposal/QmVCk8KLaiRS8QCRFdJyHpirAzCNEfRnnD3JXa2veKY2Ng), [AAVE-39](https://snapshot.org/#/index-coop.eth/proposal/QmW11v7wH4jftquv4nTf1ecAuhkyiNvnXFS2uGCVoDLL37).
