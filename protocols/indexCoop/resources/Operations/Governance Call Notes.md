This first governance call was mostly focused on finding alignment on vision and strategy for the next steps of the Index Coop. Members seemed to rally around the idea of pushing adoption of the DPI Set over the next 2 months.

Some TODO items from the call:

-   Work on expanding independent UI for servicing DPI and Index Coop products (separate fromÂ [Tokensets.com](http://tokensets.com/)). It would be great to have a site dedicated to crypto ETFs
-   Put together a marketing/meme plan to begin pushing wider adoption of the Index Coop
-   Discuss & expand community contribution mechanism. How should community contributions be rewarded?
-   Discuss & expand on how to handle community delegates for collateral protocol tokens in the DPI Set.

This second governance call was mostly focused on the next product upgrades to the DPI Set.

1.  How should we increase productivity of DPIs underlying assets?

2.  How do we think about platform upgrades and product upgrades for DPI?

3.  Where do product sustainabilty goals (e.g. minting/redeeming fee revenue) fit in?

Some TODO items from the call:

-   Set up a dedicated call to discuss product/org improvements (i.e. dedicated to answering just the questions above)
