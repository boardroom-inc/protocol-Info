**What PowerPool is all about?**

PowerPool is a decentralized protocol for automatically managed token portfolios, and smart indices. The protocol uses capital stored in portfolios/indices for generating additional yield from staking, vaults, and meta-governance. PowerPool is governed by CVP token holders, including protocol upgrades, new indices, portfolio strategies, and usage of meta-governance power. 

**Index-like products**
PowerPool indices and automatically traded portfolios are built on top of Balancer AMM and use the capital for meta-governance and staking (coming soon). Protocol architecture allows launching a broad variety of products including indices/portfolios with complex rebalancing strategies/dynamic weights changing, productive usage of assets/meta-governance, including indices composed of derivative tokens. Currently, the CVP community launched four products: PIPT, YETI, ASSY, and YLA.

**Power Agent**
Power Agent (or Power Poke) automatically executes on-chain maintenance operations such as TWAP prices, rebalancing AMM weights, processing batched transactions, and executing asset swaps for xCVP (Coming Soon).

Power Agent is managed by two agents - Poker Agent and Fishermen. Each role is required to stake CVP as a deposit. The address with the largest deposit becomes the Poker Agent, while the rest become Fishermen. The Poker Agent is responsible for performing all of Power Poke’s on-chain operations, while the Fishermen are responsible for slashing the Poker Agent if there’s any failure. The Poker Agent and Fishermen are both rewarded for their work in CVP.

**CVP Token**
CVP is a Governance token that governs the PowerPool protocol. CVP holders vote to approve protocol upgrades, new indices, portfolio strategies, treasury management, and usage of meta-governance power. Power Agent maintainers use CVP as a deposit and get reward in CVP. In addition, protocol fees are distributed to holders staking CVP to xCVP(coming soon).
