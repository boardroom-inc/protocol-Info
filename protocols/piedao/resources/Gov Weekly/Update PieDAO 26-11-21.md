## Summary

<!--Write a brief summary, TL;DR, covering the important governance and DAO events of the week.-->

TL;DR:
PieDAO deployed some interesting features for Liquidity Providers this week! Following PIP-67 an eDough to veDough bridge has been built to allow eDough that has vested for 6 months to be staked. With the new interfaces LPs will be able to review their positions, vesting times, and easily see their total status. Further two quick votes were held regarding Treasury management and one regarding partnering with Olympus DAO is pending.
