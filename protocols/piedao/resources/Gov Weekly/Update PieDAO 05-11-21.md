## Summary

<!--Write a brief summary, TL;DR, covering the important governance and DAO events of the week.-->
TL;DR: Lots of excitement this week as the warm glow from Lisbon continues. $PLAY is hitting its ATH as best scoring index. The first month of $DOUGH staking has already exceeded its first KPI. Stats: 10.7 Million Dough Staked, Avg Time of 34 Months, 246 Voting Addresses. Hodlers who won a Zombie State University NFT are looking ghastly on Twitter/Discord. Plus a new vote is up that lasts only a day, get yours in!
