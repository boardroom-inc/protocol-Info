PieDAO is a community DAO focused on tokenising automated wealth creation strategies. The DAO'S first line of products are called Pies, yield-generating tokenized portfolio allocations. The PieDAO community envisions a world where wealth creation is a passive, automated process accessible to anyone with an internet connection without heavy prerequisites, while strategies to create wealth are in the hands of the most objectively talented individuals, distributed across the globe and correctly incentivized.


#### Governance

Any Dough holder can choose to stake for 6 to 36 months, and receive Voting Escrow Dough (veDough) in exchange. The selected staking period and token amount will determine a user’s voting power and share of DAO profit. Since only veDough holders have voting power, this means no free-riding, no swaying votes for short-term gain, and true long-term alignment for the future of PieDAO. Improvments and changes to the DAO follow a three step process:

1. Discussion / Idea

    An idea discussion is the first step to propose a PIP, during this phase it is likely no model for changes will exist, no technical spec, nor exact steps for implemention. Ideas are important as they allow members to be creative, it’s important to make sure those ideas progress into actionable PIP in order to be implemented.

2. Pie Improvement Proposal / PIP

    A PIP is an actionable step for the DAO to be working on. In the case of a new Pie it includes a detailed model and the motivation behind the new product, any relevant partnership to launch it, and a timeline to make it happen. In the case of a rebalance for a Pie, it includes a detailed breakdown of the new allocation and how it compared to the old one, the reasoning behind it and other relevant information to execute on it by devs. For all other topics, a detailed explanation of the impacts, reasoning, and steps necessary for implantation are detailed. 

3. Snapshot

    A typical snapshot vote is kicked off for all veDough holders

#### Revenue Sharing

The PieDAO recently launched our [Dough staking program](https://www.piedao.org/#/dough-staking-campaign), a new revenue sharing and governance model. In this model, any Dough holder can choose to stake their holdings for a period between 6 months and 3 years, receiving am amount of Voting Escrow Dough (veDough) in return. Active veDough holders will get 60% of DAO profits, while 25% will be used to compound the treasury and 15% will be allocated to development costs.

#### Meta-Governance

Meta-governance allows veDough holders to govern the underlying assets in Pies. When important votes occur involving the governance tokens held in a PieDAO product a duplicate snapshot vote is created for veDough holders. The outcome of this vote informs how the Dao will vote
