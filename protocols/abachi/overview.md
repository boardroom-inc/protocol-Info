# Abachi
 - We aim to build, acquire and support tools that will bridge tradfi and defi
 - We aim to build an open bonds and credit market for permissioned lenders.
 - We aim to acquire and support projects that are integral to our mission.

## Overview 
- Abachi is currently rolling out permissioned lending pools.
### What is a Abachi

Abachi is a platform that builds, funds and acquires tech that will onboard real world businesses to DeFi.

A staking mechanism that has an inflationary emission that starts at 192,300 and finishes at 10 million based on the Olympus DAO technology but without any backing via the main treasury. Backing is provided by utility of the token and a minimum viable price to keep the token functional and mint tokens only when demand for staking is high.

### What is Abachi Core

Abachi Core is the fundamental infrastructure and set of tools / SDKs that will enable traditional finance apps & services to interact with Abachi's DeFi tech. 

Some key components of Abachi Core are
* Fund / Build a **multi-chain wallet** which can be used via an SDK for partners, the wallet should enable recovery for real-world users and partners that are using the SDK to provide these services. 
* Launch (accredited & non-accredited) **stable coin pools** incentivized by ABI with the highest yields possible in the market. 
* Provide the **middleware services to partners** that can onboard real world users. e.g. Luca Plus, which has already completed the KYC & AML for them, and can tap into a shared pool of accredited lenders and borrowers. This again increases as more partners onboard as all of them can share the same pool. 
* **Tokenize these pools** and offer more complex markets with various yields from TradFi. E.g. Junk Bonds, Junk Credit pools. These would then become CDOs offered on-chain to an accredited market of buyers and sellers. 
* **Tokenize accreditation**, entity risks (credit scores) and KYC requirements so they can carry across when using shared pools. 
* Launch **markets for rated credit instruments** (e.g. CDOs), launch markets for on-chain currency swaps, launch markets for physical asset based lending.

## Governance 
- Governance is powered via Snapshot and Discussions on our discourse.
- Governance is currently offchain, however we plan to move it on chain in the future.
- pABI, ABI and gABI all tokens carry an equal vote for governance.
- Any one can create a proposal, DAO members have author rights. Holders can vote.

It is important to understand that Abachi is not a DAO when it will launch. Governance of Abachi is not dependent on the number of tokens you hold. While we are committed to moving Abachi to a completely decentralised and DAO structure, this will happen in the future when legislations around DAOs are clearly defined. 

Once the staking contract is launched the governance will move to a DAO with treasuries also moved to multiple signers.

Here are some important considerations to keep in mind:
1. ABI is a utility token which powers all core services, and the staking mechanism only provides a minimum viable price backing for the token. It does this by utilising a portion of its current treasury to buy back and burn the token removing it from circulation.  As the price of the token fluctuates, the supply of the token will also fluctuate based on demand and the need from core services.

1. Governance of the protocol and community contributors will have a say in protocol decisions and we will be publishing everything in an open and transparent way. Read more about governance here. When Abachi does indeed move to a decentralized autonomous organizational structure we may make changes to governance however this should not be assumed. 
1. Abachi token itself carries no value. The value of the token is created as more services are added and use the token. This drives a burn and buyback mechanism. The second way the protocol tries to keep itself healthy to grow is to acquire OHM as much as possible to bootstrap its treasury. We strongly believe OHM is that asset. This is no different than any other protocol keeping their treasury in their own native coin. e.g. Ethereum Foundation keeps a healthy portion in ETH and Block.One acquried bitcoin for its treasury. 

1. As inflation increases throughout the protocol with staking rewards, the protocol will try to balance its staking rewards and may bring them down. There will only ever be a maximum of 10 million ABI tokens that can be minted. 

1. APY on staking calculations in Abachi are based on current circulating ABI, number of stakers & RFV.
    1. If the number of people staking goes down, the protocol will increase its staking rewards to incentivize more people to stake.
    1. If the price falls below the RFV the protocol will try and maximise to increase the treasury holdings to lend ABI a minimum viable price support. It does this by acquiring more OHM and discounting stable coin minting of ABI (bonds).
    1. The backing price of ABI has absolutely no bearing on market price of ABI as the protocol will never go back and buy ABI from the market. The treasury is utilised as outlined in our treasury section. 
1. Abachi uses the open source Olympus DAO code and technology to let users deposit and mint new tokens, and also stake them. It does not use all the calculations Olympus currently uses to maintain its BCV, RFV and Backing.
