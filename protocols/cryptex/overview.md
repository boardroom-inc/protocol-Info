 # Cryptex

Cryptex is the world's first total crypto market cap token.

## Overview

### Understanding Cryptex

Cryptex is focused on building innovative, open source financial products for the global Crypto community. Using Ethereumâ€™s smart contract system, Cryptex is able to build decentralized financial instruments such as [Total Market Cap(TCAP) Token](https://docs.cryptex.finance/tcap/) and many others. With real world data on the Ethereum blockchain along with collateralized backings for generating tokens, these products were previously not possible without a centralized custodian or manager. Now, Cryptex is providing the framework for decentralized financial products that offer exposure to more than just BTC, ETH, and other DeFi tokens.

Capturing exposure to the Total Market Cap of all cryptocurrency projects requires real world data, from multiple sources, on Ethereum. In the world of decentralized financial products, accessing global data on the blockchain is one of the more difficult problems. Chainlink enables Cryptex to aggregate multiple data points from external sources within the smart contract framework on Ethereum. Using a trust minimized oracle framework allows TCAP to minimize trust of Cryptex and ultimately serve as a better trustless financial product.

### What is TCAP?

For cryptocurrency investors, traders, funds, DeFi users, and insitutions, TCAP is an ERC-20 compatible smart contract that tokenizes real-time Total Market Capitalization from all cryptocurrencies and tokens listed on the most reputable crypto data providers in the world.

Combining blockchain technology with the process of data aggregation, over $1 trillion of raw market capitalization data can be brought to market via crosscollateralized, asset nominal tokenization. Asset nominal tokenization starts with the process of taking a data metric, such as Total Market Capitalization. This metric is then set to a divisor of 10,000,000,000. The new, nominal asset token value now trades in lockstep with the underlying data metric it tracks.

Collateralizing the new smart contract against multiple assets like ETH or DAI provides the security that this new tokenized asset is backed by a set of rules and collateral enforced by an Ethereum smart contract, thereby tokenizing total market capitalization.

## Governance

### CTX

ERC-20 Token in charge of the Governance of the Protocol. Owners of the CTX Token are able to make proposals and vote to make protocol changes. Read more details on the [CTX Reference](https://docs.cryptex.finance/governance/reference/#read-only-functions-ctx).

### Governor Alpha

This contract is in charge of managing proposals and actions, CTX holders call it to vote or create new proposals with actions that will be queued into the Timelock if the voting is successful. Read more details on the [Governor Alpha Reference](https://docs.cryptex.finance/governance/reference/#read-only-functions-governor-alpha).

### Timelock

The Timelock contract can modify system parameters, logic, and contracts in a 'time-delayed, opt-out' upgrade pattern. Read more details on the Timelock Reference

### Orchestrator

The Orchestrator acts as the owner of some of the TCAP Protocol Components. The Orchestrator functions can only be called by it's owner, the Timelock Contract controlled by CTX Governance. Read more details on the Orchestrator Contract.
