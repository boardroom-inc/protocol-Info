**Digital Reserve Currency was designed to become a decentralized digital store of value with a limited supply and a zero inflation rate.**

The DRC Foundation was created to establish a community-driven governance of the DRC ecosystem. We believe that the most important decisions regarding the development of the DRC ecosystem should be made exclusively by DRC token holders. Holders of DRC can create new proposals and vote on any changes to DRC and its ecosystem.

The governance system of DRC is truly unique because we do not have managers or even core contributors. No one has managerial control over the DRC network. Our goal is to create a decentralized ecosystem, to the fullest extent possible. We believe this will make DRC compliant and at the same time, an autonomous and censorship-resistant digital store of value.

DRC is an ERC20 token that was designed to become a decentralized digital store of value with a limited supply of one billion indivisible tokens and a zero inflation rate. DRC is a monetary experiment conducted with the purpose of finding out how the global economic recession and the increasing demand for decentralized financial instruments may affect its global adoption and usage.
