**StarkNet is a permissionless, decentralized Layer 2 (L2) Validity Rollup (often referred to as ZK-Rollup), intended to scale Ethereum while retaining Ethereum’s security and decentralization.**

The Foundation will be in charge of facilitating sound governance and formulating the voting mechanisms. The StarkNet Token was designed to allow both direct voting and a range of delegation mechanisms.

Governance Process
------------------
Two processes are being advanced simultaneously in order to fulfill StarkNet’s vision to become a censorship-resistant public network: (i) decentralization of StarkNet’s system components, e.g., sequencers and provers, and (ii) implementation of governance mechanisms regarding protocol changes. The first phase of the governance process use the following structure:

#### Voting Subject
Proposed upgrades to the StarkNet protocol. All upgrades, at this stage, will be proposed by the Foundation. The proposals will reflect discussions, ideas, and feedback raised in the StarkNet Community Forum.

#### Voting type
Off-chain signal vote (via Snapshot)

#### Voting Process
The Foundation will deploy an updated version of StarkNet to Goerli.
Voters will have a 6-day period to examine the upgraded version as it runs on Goerli. During this time, they can vote on whether to approve it for Mainnet deployment.
If a proposal is approved by voters, there will then be a delay of 24+ hours before applying the upgrade to Mainnet.
Announcements for these updates will be made on the Twitter account of the StarkNet Foundation, as well as on the StarkNet Community Forum.

#### Threshold and Required Quorum
Threshold is a simple majority (i.e., the threshold is 50% of votes cast)
No required quorum, meaning that there is no minimum level of participation for the vote to be valid
