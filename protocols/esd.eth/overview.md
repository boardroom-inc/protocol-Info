# Empty Set Dollar

Empty Set protocol is a community owned 'de-central bank' that issues a decentralised stablecoin. The protocol mints & redeems a stablecoin backed by a reserve of assets and is governed by a separate governance token.

In essence: Emptyset is a wrapper for stablecoins. The protocol consumes a particular collateral, places it into a reserve and issues a stablecoin, known as DSU, against it. The act of wrapping has a number of benefits, ranging from trust-minimization to risk reduction for upstream protocols.

# Overview

Using a variety of mechanisms Empty Set is able to achieve a number of unique properties:

* Simple - Empty Set has few dependancies, reducing protocol risk.
* Backed - Digital Standard Unit (DSU) token is 100% backed by low risk collateral.
* Future-proof - Empty Set's ethos is un-governance however the protocol can be upgraded to respond to new risks.
* Community Owned - Protocols that integrate DSU are able to participate in governance.
* Composable - Both DSU & Empty Set Share (ESS) are fully ERC-20 compliant and composable into other platforms.

# Governance

The Empty Set Dollar project operates as a DAO, allowing those who have ESS bonded in the DAO to propose on and vote for proposals that shape the evolution of the protocol.

## Here’s how it works:

Proposals are created and discussed in dedicated channels in the [ESD project Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vPws9Vp).

Proposals that proceed to vote are added to the Governance screen of the ESD platform.

If you have ESS bonded in the DAO, you can click the “Go To” button on any active proposal, and vote in favor or against the proposal.

## Important to know:

Voting for a given proposal usually lasts for nine epochs, during which the DAO tokens of voters are locked (but still earning rewards). Many people wait to vote in the last epoch, to be locked for the minimum amount of time.

## Tokens

The Empty Set protocol has two tokens:

* Digital Standard Unit (DSU)
DSU is the stablecoin the protocol issues. This token's purpose is to serve as an analogue to other liability backed stablecoins while offering greater decentralisation.

This token is freely mint-able from the Empty Set reserve and can also be redeemed for assets in the Reserve.

* Empty Set Share (ESS)
ESS is the protocol's governance token. It can be used to vote or propose governance actions within the protocol.
