# Rari Capital
## Overview
Rari Capital is a suite of decentralized finance protocols on a mission to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical minds, in order to bring the next wave of mass users into this industry.

We have built a series of products that create and deliver aggregate yield, allowing you a simple and safe avenue of value-accrual to your existing assets.

*Fuse:* Open interest rate protocol that provides users the ability to create and manage customizable lending/borrowing pools.

*Yield Aggregator:* An autonomous algorithm that rebalances users’ funds into the highest-yield opportunities. Staked funds also provide liquidity to Fuse pools for borrowers.

*Tranches:* Peer-to-peer risk exchange protocol that utilizes the Yield Aggregator DAI pool for customized risk and return profiles.

*Pool 2:* Incentives for RGT liquidity providers on decentralized exchanges.

## Governance

Rari Capital DAO is in the process of changing its organizational structure and governance. We envision a structure that ensures sufficient efficiency and scalability, while maintaining creative freedom for its members. For more details on this vision, check out these resources.

At a high-level, the Rari Capital DAO is governed by its community of RGT holders. All members are responsible for providing the vision and goals for Rari, and for interacting with its active contributors to help build this vision. Contributors are organized in the form of independent working groups called taskforces, as outlined below. If you’d like to know how you can contribute, here

### Organization structure
Contributors to Rari are organized in the form of taskforces. Each taskforce is an independent working group, with its own specified objective or vision. Taskforces have a large degree of autonomy in terms of how they spend their resources, how they hire and collaborate with contributors, what decisions they take to achieve their vision and so forth. Taskforces periodically report their progress to the DAO and request resources if needed.

### Current taskforces
Infrastructure taskforce: Building the most robust underlying lending and borrowing protocol and setting up the proper infrastructure to enable it to thrive without the infrastructure team. Coordinators: Jack and Samuel
Market XYZ taskforce: Building a front-end and business for the Rari Protocol that are accessible to all. Exploring some more exotic use cases of the underlying protocol (ie idea markets). Emphasis on Layer 2. Coordinators: Rahul and Erik
Generalized applications taskforce: Building out integrations and applications on top of the Rari Protocol. In early stages. Coordinators: David, Jai, and Ben
See How to contribute.

### Community governance
Governance includes both an on-chain and an off-chain component. Consensus amongst community members is often formed off-chain, therefore we place significant importance on ensuring robust processes for the same to develop. The DAO will host regular community calls, and maintain social channels such as discord and the forum where various members can express their opinion. Each taskforce will additionally have their own way of communicating with the community, and onboard more active contributors.
