## About

API3 is leading the movement from legacy third-party oracle networks to first-party oracle solutions that deliver more security, efficiency, regulatory compliance, and simplicity. 

Without third-party node operators, API3 data feeds are never exposed to data tampering and denial of service attacks by middlemen. This enables them to reach higher cost-efficiency, while having fewer attack surfaces and also avoiding providers' data resale terms of service violations. Source-level decentralization of dAPIs is enabled by Airnode, a fully serverless oracle node that can be deployed by any API provider for free, and requires minimal day-to-day management.

API3 data feeds are governed by an open DAO of stakeholders, industry experts and project partners. This allows dAPIs to be operated with maximal transparency, minimal required trust in centralized operators, and no centralized attack surfaces. API token holders can take a direct part in governing the project by staking API3 tokens into the API3 insurance staking contract, which grants them voting power in the API3 DAO.

API3 provides dAPI users with the option of on-chain insurance (currently under development), powered by the API3 token and Kleros’ decentralized courts. API3’s insurance feature gives dAPI users a quantifiable safety net in the event of a malfunction, holds the API3 DAO directly responsible for the security of the dAPIs and incentivizes a security-first governance approach for dAPIs and the API3 project as a whole.

## Ecosystem

Demonstrated by the [API3 Alliance](https://api3.org/alliance), API3 DAO has introduced the largest association of API providers to Web3, who will deploy Airnodes to feed their data to Web3 end users. API3 Alliance members empower decentralized applications to directly call their Web APIs.

The [Open Bank Project](https://www.openbankproject.com/) is API3’s open banking partner and the leading open-source API solution provider for banks, assisting them in the deployment of open banking platforms. Through API3’s Airnode first-party oracle solution, the Open Bank Project provides developers in the Web 3.0 space with access to over 400 standardized open banking APIs, ready to be connected to innovative blockchain-powered solutions. Such APIs and usecases include Onboarding and KYC, Accounts, Transactions, Counterparties, Branches, ATMs, and Metadata.

The [API3 University Initiative](https://api3.org/university) is an academic focused program to inspire, advance, and evangelize the API3 Airnode and API3’s blockchain oracle solution.

## Governance

Users must stake API3 tokens in the [governance contract](https://api3.eth.link/#/) to be eligible for rewards, to vote, and to create proposals. Proposers must have staked (or received delegation from) a total of 0.1% of the voting power, and can only submit a proposal once every 7 days. Proposals can be submitted to either the Primary or Secondary voting app. These two apps have access to separate treasuries, have different voting settings, and have different permissions to change contract settings.

Proposals currently open for voting can be found in the "Governance" tab of the DAO front end, and a list of past proposals is found in the "History" tab. "Yes" or "no" votes can be cast on any active proposal's details page, by any user with voting power.

Everyone who has staked API3 tokens into the [pool contract](https://docs.api3.org/pre-alpha/members/contract-architecture/pool.html) will earn API3 token rewards in accordance with the [floating staking reward rate](https://docs.api3.org/pre-alpha/members/staking/rewards.html). Staking rewards become withdrawable one year from the time of earning, but unstaking of contributed tokens may be initiated at any time. Unstaking cooldown period is currently 7 days, but this is governable by the DAO along with [numerous other governance contract parameters](https://docs.api3.org/pre-alpha/members/governance/proposals.html), including the staking target and min/max thresholds.
