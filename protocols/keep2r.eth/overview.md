# Keep2r

An Advanced & Incentive Enabled Decentralize Financial System.

Inspired by Andre Cronje’s Keeper Network “Keep2r Network” idea was born. While the DeFi space was flooding with poor attempts on making a successful fork implementation of the real one, none actually had the core functionalities baked into them to able to be even called as a successful fork. The DeFi God had some clear qualities in his version of keeper but others upon failing on doing so made millions just by creating fake hypes in the DeFi space. Following on his footsteps Keep2r Network is committed to make all the necessary developments live first then put it out to users for evaluation. We believe real developers don’t ask for funds based upon fake promises rather putting the hard works first and then let the people decide its worth.

Keep2r Network is doing just that, making developments live beforehand and then let you guys decide!

Keep2r Network is a decentralized keeper network inspired by the DeFi Guru ‘Andre Cronje’ needing external develops and for external teams to find keeper jobs. It’s basically can be described as a ‘Job Matching’ site.

# Governance

KP2R governance by design has a low overhead, it is not meant to be protocol intensive. The focus is simply on reviewing and approving jobs, and if absolutely required mitigate disputes or blacklist keepers.

## Participants

Only bonded Keepers may participate in governance. To participate in governance a keeper must first bond KPR, once bonded they can delegate voting rights to either themselves or another party.

## Managing Jobs

The core function of governance is to approve and include jobs, when liquidity is provided for a job, a proposal is automatically created to include them for review. Bonded keepers will review the contracts and decide if they should be included. It is important that jobs code defensively, assume keepers will only include your job to maximize their returns, as such maximum payment thresholds have been implemented.

## Managing Keepers

As a last resort, governance has certain rights over managing Keepers, these include lodging disputes, slashing, revoking access, and resolving disputes.
