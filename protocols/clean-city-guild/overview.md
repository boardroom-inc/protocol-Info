The Clean City Guild (CCG) is the first community-led decentralized autonomous organization focused on taking iniatives to keep our cities clean.

CCG will allow citizens to discuss and vote on city cleaning initiatives, campagins and events. Local authorities will also be able to collaborate on city cleaning campaigns.

Citizens participating in the city cleaning drives will be awarded NFT badges for their contribution.

#### CCG Improvement Proposals (CCGIP)

A CCGIP is a proposal to change or update some standards about the working of CCG. CCGIPs can vary from proposing new criteria to select city cleaning venues, collaboartion model with local authorities, funding for special campaigns and upgrade of CCG smart contracts.

We follow similar process to Ethereum's EIP process.
