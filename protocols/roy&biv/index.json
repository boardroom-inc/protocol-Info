    "description": "Roy and Biv were two brothers from a dimension known as the \"Chromatic Realm,\" a place where all matter was imbued with color and beauty. Their world was a paradise, but it was also a fragile one. The Chromatic Realm was held together by a magical force known as the Rainbow Bridge, which connected all the different planes of existence within their world.\n\nHowever, the Rainbow Bridge had started to deteriorate, causing the Chromatic Realm to slowly collapse. Roy and Biv knew they had to escape before it was too late. They packed up their things and set out on a journey to find a way out of their collapsing dimension.\n\nAs they traveled, they encountered all sorts of strange and dangerous creatures, but they never lost hope. They knew that there had to be a way to save their world and the people they loved.\n\nFinally, after many months of searching, they stumbled upon a portal that led to another dimension. Without hesitation, they stepped through the portal, leaving the Chromatic Realm behind.\n\nAs they emerged on the other side, they were greeted by a world unlike any they had ever seen. It was a world filled with endless possibilities, and they knew that this was where they belonged. Together, they started a new life in this new dimension, always remembering the home they had left behind.\n\n--------\n\nIn a game we previously made, Roy and Biv are two brothers escaping from a collapsing dimension. It was released on iOS and Android in 2015 and was discontinued shortly after. We are reviving them under CC0. No roadmap, just Roy and Biv.",
