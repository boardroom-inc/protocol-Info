### Our Mission 

## We’re on a mission to bring more Community professionals into web3.

*“Building a community is helping people, help others.”*

Being vital to the success of web3 projects, there is a huge demand online for Community Moderators, Community Managers, Community Directors, Community Leads or more technical positions like Developer Evangelists, Developer Advocates.

**This community was built for educating up and coming community professionals and leaders in the web3 space. To meet this talent gap in our current state—our aim is to:** 
  
*Open source resources such as standards, strategies and tools that will support this future workforce
*Design bootcamps and workshops that help grow the talent pool of the space overall
*Be the leading DAO-as-a-Service for Community development in web3

## We believe community professionals are the role of the future.

In web3, there is a huge demand online for Community Moderators, Community Managers, Community Directors, Community Leads or more technical positions like Developer Evangelists, Developer Advocates. Being a vital aspect to the success of web3 projects, community roles are a growing trend.

Through Wgmi—we’re assembling the brightest minds from web2 to web3 that have built online communities to… open source this knowledge and onboard the next generation of Community professionals. By sharing resources, experiences, tools, processes, and evangelizing newcomers to roll up their sleeves—we can create a factory of leaders that will be guiding the next generation of developments on Ethereum with respect to DeFi, NFTs, DAOs and more.

## Wgmi Community Lore

Brewing from a Tweet, there was demonstrated an obvious demand from both companies seeking web3 community managers and crypto natives seeking a role as a community professional. In web2 there are quite a few community managers, directors, leaders, advocates, ambassadors… but we have yet to bridge them over to web3 where their skills are highly demanded. In web3, there are some additional learnings such as using IRC (e.g. Discord), Mobile Chat (e.g. Telegram), Social Media (e.g. Twitter), Wallets (e.g. Metamask) and various tokens (e.g. erc-721s/NFTs, erc-20s, L2s, testnets, sidechains on Ethereum) as gated experiences. There is also the knowledge-base of the NFT, DeFi, protocol layer and various other complexities to the blockchain, web3, Ethereum ecosystem that we as community folks need to unbundle.

The goal of this community is to bridge folks into this new world, offer them the standards from community professionals across the world (not in web3) and with community experts in web3. At our disposal we have some of the world’s best community folks looking at this industry. We’re here to bring everyone to this side of things, learn from community professionals cut from any fabric, and tie in web3 learnings from the other half of folks in the space.

## Our Culture…

**Community first** — attributed to Metacartel’s Community-First Manifesto, we’re focused on what brings value back to our immediate community and the wider Ethereum ecosystem at large. We care more about making impact over time versus creating fomo around prospective monetary value of "community".

**Radical transparency** — There is no “us” and “them” in Community. There is only the monster of coordination that we are all fighting over—in web3 we call this “moloch”. Web3 culture is about building in public, transparent governance, and deploying in open source. The success of the community is how efficiently we can deploy work, and how engaged we can bring in the wider community.

**Collaboration** — The internet sure did not build itself. There is also not one founder of the web, of blockchain, of Etheruem. There are thousands of engineers, contributors, inventors, creators, and entrepreneurs that made the access to connectivity what it is today. We believe heavily in leveraging everyone’s skills to achieve a common goal.

**Contribution** — We believe in solving problems, fixing issues and participating for the sake of Community. Our members willingly contribute code, content, communication, and effort to help the greater cause. There is the understanding that work = incentives and recognition based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, however, to gain the community’s trust, value is interpreted as how much you contribute to the whole before you're to expect anything in return. This is our culture; we give more than we take.

## The vision ahead…

The world is changing rapidly and folks are trying to figure out how to add value in their careers. As online communities are flourishing and digital assets on blockchains, Ethereum specifically, are creating self-custodial experiences—we’re excited to support and bolster this emerging workforce.

Looking ahead, we imagine wgmi will hire and off-board thousands of Community professionals into the web3 ecosystem over time. We see a world where community leaders, directors, managers and more—are leading the future businesses and technologies of the world.
Our focus is around setting standards and common practices between Community professionals, to fill the talent gap, and make sure every project in web3 is able to execute on a Community-first mindset.

**Join the revolution with us. We’re putting the WE in web3.**
