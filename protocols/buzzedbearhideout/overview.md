# The Buzzed Bear Hideout

The Buzzed Bear Hideout is much more than a community, we are a DAO. Every Buzzed Bear can propose, vote, and execute any new initiatives. Every time an initiative generates profits, Buzzed Bears can decide if they want to re-invest into more initiatives or distribute the profits between all the Buzzed Bears.
#### Buzzed Bear Proposals
An BB Proposal is a proposal to update some function or standard within the Buzzed Bear Hideout. BBPs can vary widely from proposing new products, to requesting funds from the Honeypot, to performing upgrades. The BBP process largely follows the same behavior as Ethereum's EIP process.
