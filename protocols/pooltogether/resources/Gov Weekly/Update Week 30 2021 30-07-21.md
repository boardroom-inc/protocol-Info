| PTIP-28: Filling the Polygon Pool | L2/Treasury | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-28-filling-the-polygon-pool/1380/2) |

Summary:\
This proposal will distribute POOL from Treasury, through the Matic Bridge to establish POOL on the Polygon network. These POOL would be sent to the USDT Pool Owner. A faucet will be created on Polygon for the USDT Pool. The USDT Pool Owner will deposit the POOL to the faucet. Additionally, this will reduce the POOL distributed to incentivize LPing through Uniswap and move those to incentivize LPing POOL/ETH on Sushiswap

Update: Ongoing discussion on how to best incorporate polygon pool
