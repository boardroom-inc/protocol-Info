| Drip PPOOL into POOL Pool | Treasury | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/drip-ppool-into-pool-pool/1300) |

Summary:\
IDEA - instead of dripping POOL to holders of PPOOL, let’s just drip PPOOL to them.
OVS - this removes the ‘claim POOL’ step and grows the PPOOL pool faster.

Update: idea brought up and [discussed](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/drip-ppool-into-pool-pool/1300/6) during community call.
