GoodDollar is the first community-led decentralized organization focused on enabling the creation of crypto Universal Basic Income.

#### GoodDollar Improvement Proposals
A GIP is a proposal to update some function, parameter or contract within the GoodDollar protocol. GIPs can vary widely from proposing a change to the reserve ratio expansion rate, proposing new DEFI integrations, to requesting funds from the treasury, to performing GoodDollar smart contract upgrades.

To create a proposal
- Start a thread the discourse forum "GIP #: title"
- TBD

### On-Chain Governance
GoodDollar protocol lives at the moment on two chains: Ethereum and Fuse, all voting takes place on-chain.
Due to high gas costs and the amount of the GoodDollar DAO members, it is not practical to vote on Ethereum, we are working on a solution where voting on Ethereum proposals will also happen on Fuse thus enabling all GoodDollar members regardless of their financial status to control also the protocol on Ethereum.
