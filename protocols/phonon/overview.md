# Phonon

Phonon is a community-owned protocol enabling off-chain transfer of digital assets using secure hardware. Turn all crypto into P2P cash: private, fast, & free.

### Mission
To share the Phonon Network with developers and users in creating an absolutely secure, digital-cash protocol, which is infinitely scalable for all digital assets. By demonstrating that 99% of all blockchain can be connected off-line, without fees and congestion, Phonon will unleash the potential of digital assets.

### Vision
Establish an open, but personally private, P2P financial network that brings the currency-freedom, which Satoshi originally intended, to all hardware devices. The Phonon Vision is to provide the ‘transportation’ of any crypto or digital asset that you already own – freely and uncensored – as digital cash.

## Overview

### What is a "Phonon"?
Regarding this Alpha Testnet, Phonons are universal containers to wrap any crypto asset that can be then sent over the Phonon Network: the hardware-secured protocol. Learn more about Native Phonons and Backed Phonons here. Exchange any cryptocurrency for free, securely and privately – this is the Phonon way.

### Our Story

The Phonon Network is the invention of Dr. Karl Kreder of GridPlus, the team responsible for the Lattice1, the most secure cold-storage product on the market. After GridPlus developed the basic framework of the protocol it then spun out the Phonon DAO to manage the protocol and to help build additional services and applications on top of the framework. Additionally, the DAO is here to facilitate other people developing applications and making improvements on the network.

The DAO, has been entrusted to also oversee processes when certifying hardware (e.g., smartcards and eSIMs) and hardware manufacturers for compatibility. It also manages the DAO’s treasury and allocation of funds to build, market and improve the protocol, as well as the DAO itself.

## Governance

The Phonon DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) was initiated by GridPlus’s unprecedented burn of ~$400 million USD in token value, and is now the governing body of the Phonon Protocol. It is entrusted to grow the Protocol and Network into the world’s premier peer-to-peer payment platform.

### Token

#### PHONON Token
The PHONON token is an ERC-20 token that lives on the Ethereum network. The DAO utilizes the PHONON token within its governance structure and is used to verify DAO members’ authenticity. It’s used for voting purposes and rewards, such as protocol development, grants, bounties and community involvement. The PHONON token’s future uses include, collateral against bad actors within the manufacturers of Phonon compatible hardware (i.e. smartcards) and utilization as a bidding mechanism for mining-enabled Phonon cards (Details about mining will be announced in the near-term future).
