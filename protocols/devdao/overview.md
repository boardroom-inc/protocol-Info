# Developer DAO

The project was started as an experiment by [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3) to see what can be achieved when we bring together talented and like-minded people who are interested in learning about and building on Web3.


## The Mission

Developer DAO exists to accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of Web3 builders.


## The Values

- **Transparency** (open source everything, conversations in public, document and share the journey)
- **Diversity and Inclusion** (seek to foster as diverse a membership as possible and support everyone to contribute)
- **Responsibility** (as a self-governed community we rely on members to be personally responsible for their actions and commitments to the community)
- **Kindness and empathy** (we know that we are living in a complex, stressful, and diverse world and go out of our way to make people‚Äôs lives and days better through our interactions)


## The Goals
- Onboard, educate, and support Web3 developers
- Foster and build Web3 tools and public goods


## Governance
- Proposals can only be initiated by a Developer DAO member. *(Anyone who holds atleast 1 Devs For Revolution Token)*.
-  Every proposal which needs to be voted on by the community should be posted on the [Proposals Category](https://forum.developerdao.com/c/proposals/5) of the Developer DAO Forum.
- Before posting a proposal here, it is always advised to start an initial discussion on the [Developer DAO discord server](https://discord.gg/devdao) or on the [General category](https://forum.developerdao.com/c/general/6) of the forum.
- If a person/group of people are proposing any particular proposal, they should be ready to engage with the community e.g. by answering their replies, addressing their concerns.

### *How Do I Join?*

The DAO operates inside our [discord server](https://discord.gg/devdao). To gain access to this server you need to own a Devs for Revolution NFT. 

All the Genesis NFT are sold out however you can checkout the one's listed on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/devs-for-revolution).
