We use the word “family” with the broadest possible interpretation inclusive of all types, shapes, and sizes.  One Family Noun = One vote!\n\nLearn more at our website:\nhttps://familydao.love\n ______\n\nBidding and Settling 101\n\n**Settlement starts the next auction, anyone can settle the previous auction  **\n\nWhen an auction ends, a gas-only transaction is required to start the next auction and mint the current FamilyNoun to the winners wallet. As gas price fluctuates, the cost of settlement also fluctuates.\n\n// Settlement gas price of every 9th FamilyNoun is higher. This is due to the transaction also triggering 2 free FamilyNoun mints: The FaNounders mint and The Nouns DAO mint.\n\nBidding:\n-Once an auction starts, everyone has 18 minutes to bid.  -Anyone can bid an amount at/above 0.18 eth.  -The Amount bid is returned to bidder if they lose the auction (minus gas spent on bid transaction).\n\n// Bids at the very last minute increase the auction time. Sometimes, multiple bids are sent at the same time. This may result in bids coming in and winning an auction at the very last minute/seconds (irrespective of time increase). \n\nBid Refunds:\n-Unsuccessful bids are refunded in full.\n-The timing of refunds may be offset by 1 bidder. \n\n //This means that a refund is processed for an unsuccessful bid, when a higher bid is submitted.\n  ______\n\n We can’t wait to have you join the Family! https://familydao.love",
