Providing strategic insights and a voice for the network’s most active users


## Overview

### What is GasDAO ?

A Protocol to Protocol (Pr2Pr) business and data analytics extension of Gas DAO, creating User Extractable Value (UEV) from our extremely wide and diverse membership at first, eventually spreading to the entire Ethereum (and more) community as we gain traction and legitimacy. Gas DAO Insights is the first data driven business development arm of an on-chain DAO and uniquely fulfills our mission of giving Ethereum’s most active users a voice by allowing them to influence the direction of important protocols, DAOs, L2s and other on-chain organizations through paid, scientifically valid surveys and custom analytics offerings derived from those surveys, allowing them to conduct proper market research. While this suite of services will initially be offered to protocols given the nature of our current user base and the speed at which we can onboard crypto-native new partners, this could revolutionize the Web2 survey and alternative data industry for traditional enterprises due to the concept of cryptographically verifiable demographics (CVD). Let’s break down this term. We can now survey users for demographic data (statistical data related to populations) that is cryptographically verifiable; if a survey reveals a statistic about a group of users, we can link that to hard data about their financial state, present and past.

### Problem we are solving

Protocols today know how to build but often don’t know what to build. They rely on noisy, biased sources of information: voluntary Discord chats, small-sample directed feedback collection efforts or plain intuition to chart product roadmaps and deploy development resources. Although many of these web3 protocols have multi-billion dollar market caps, they rely on primitive survey methodology, with no means to extract actionable insights from their user data or verify the authenticity of the insights extracted from that data. 

### Value proposition to Protocols and Partners

Protocols can generate actionable insights from the most active users on the Ethereum network or any targeted sub-group of users with cryptographically verifiable demographics that lead to tailored solutions for their biggest challenges. For example, protocols searching for new features to capture market share can test demand ahead of time or can more accurately predict and diagnose why users have switched to competitors.

### Sizing the market

- The Global Market Research industry in 2019 was $79B. 
- As web3 protocols mature, if their budget allocation were to turn into even half that of web2 firms, we would be the sole player in a potentially multi-billion TAM. 
- Our closest web2 analogues are Qualtrics ($16bnn Market Cap), Nielsen ($7.5bn) and Survey Monkey ($3bn). The emphasis on predictive, bespoke analytics and verifiable sample data would differentiate us from these companies and is similar to services offered by IBM, Oracle and Salesforce.

### Value Prop to Gas DAO. 

Partnerships with other protocols evolve past simple co-marketing and sharing of unsustainable reward emissions, and become circular economic linkages. Protocols extract value from our wide user base (eventually the entire network based on targeted demographics) to improve their product offerings, marketability and brand while Gas DAO receives either hard assets (sent to the treasury) or continual demand for GAS tokens (if protocols choose to pay in ΞGAS). Protocols purchase GAS tokens for analytics campaigns and members stake GAS tokens to participate in these surveys and gain rewards from analytics purchases, creating a positive feedback loop and Super DAO Flywheel.

### How This Works. 
Gas DAO will collaborate with partners to construct scientifically valid surveys, which will help gauge the developments that Ethereum users actually want, allowing partners to allocate resources more efficiently. The core Gas DAO team will create infrastructure to customize and serve the surveys, which we’ll host on a partner branded sub-domain (e.g. uniswap.gasdao.org). Survey takers will log in on our site using their Ethereum account; users will then sign a transaction to cryptographically verify their identity after taking the survey (cryptographically verifying their responses). The Gas DAO core team will then process the raw survey data into actionable insights and analytics for protocols, as well as deliver row-level data to the protocols for further analytics. In the future, Gas DAO Insights will build additional infrastructure for survey construction, viewing and creating insights and general analytics, automating as much of the process as possible to encourage further decentralization. 

## Governance 

The steps to getting a proposal approved on-chain are:

**Heat check:** The first step in getting a proposal to be executed on-chain is to post a Heat check on Snapshot. This proposal should be general, asking a question, or proposing an action the DAO should take. If the heat check gains traction, one of our contributors can post it on your behalf. This is to gauge interest in your proposal. Eventually, we will be releasing a Discourse-like forum for governance-related discussion where you need to hold a small amount of GAS tokens to make posts.

**Consensus check:** After the heat check passes, you can publish a Consensus Check on Snapshot. This should include the full details of the proposal, including rationale, execution, pros, and cons, and the full on-chain proposal parameters.

**On-chain check:** After passing the consensus check, the proposal can be made on-chain. In the coming days, you can use Tally and Boardroom to delegate and cast votes.
