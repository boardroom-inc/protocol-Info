Overview of protocol and governance process.
# Moon DAO

MoonDAO is going to the moon.

## Overview
### Mission
MoonDAO is an international collective of people united by the mission of decentralizing access to space research and exploration. We are currently living at the inflection point of a privatized space race, and the implications of this moment will define our future. Making life multi-planetary is one of the most inspiring and important missions in our lifetime. The big question is: how? We believe that an international, decentralized, inclusive, and transparent organization would be much better aligned with the needs of the everyday person.

### Values
Space should be in the hands of the people.
We uphold values of inclusion, peace, transparency, freedom of organization and speech. Space should be in the hands of the people, not any one nation or private entity.

As such, MoonDAO will support funding for individuals to go to space and fund future space research and exploration as it fits into the mission of becoming a governing body for the moon and other celestial bodies.

It is very important to note that the core team has not pre-mined any tokens for ourselves. We have not given “special terms” to any Venture Capitalists, Influencers, Angel Investors, Rich Friends or Family, or any other person. We are all being treated equally.

### Our plan to send a MoonDAO member to space in 2022:
1. Offer [$MOONEY governance tokens](https://moondao.com/docs/token) to begin decentralized community governance of MoonDAO. This will be our only supply of tokens.
1. Purchase a ticket to space with Blue Origin!
1. Release the Ticket To Space NFT collection. These NFTs will give you a chance to fly to space in 2022.
1. Send MoonDAO member(s) to space in 2022
