# Hop Protocol

## Overview

The Hop protocol provides a scalable rollup-to-rollup General Token Bridge
using a two-pronged approach:
1. Create a cross-network bridge token that can be quickly and economically
moved from rollup to rollup or claimed on layer-1 for its underlying asset.
2. Use Automated Market Makers to swap between each bridge token and
its corresponding Canonical Tokens on each rollup in order to dynamically price liquidity and incentivize the rebalancing of liquidity across the
network.
The combined approach allows users to quickly and trustlessly swap between
layer-2 Canonical Tokens using the specialized bridge token as an intermediary
asset
