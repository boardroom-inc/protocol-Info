# The Graph Council

## Overview

The Graph is a core protocol for Web3, enabling the efficient querying of blockchain data in a decentralized market, and is already relied on by some of the most widely used projects in this space to the tune of billions of queries per month. The mandate of The Graph Council will be to make sure The Graph continues to be a stable foundation for applications that are designed to run forever, while also fulfilling The Graph’s vision of becoming a global open API layer for decentralized data.

When The Graph’s decentralized network launches, it will be governed by The Graph Council. This council will be a 6-of-10 multisig that balances the interests of five core stakeholder groups: Indexers, active token holders, the initial team, users and technical domain experts.

As the protocol matures, The Graph’s governance will decentralize further, following in the footsteps of projects like Compound, MakerDAO and Livepeer, which have taken a similar path. For example, a future evolution of The Graph Council could be to replace individual members with nested multsigs or DAOs, allowing core interest groups to have meta-governance so more stakeholders can participate.

In addition to technical governance, The Graph Council will govern over The Graph Foundation community grants from the foundation’s GRT allocation. As described in part one, The Graph Foundation will also be accountable to The Graph Council, both legally and financially.

The Graph Council will carry out its mandate to oversee several core functions:

1. The Graph Foundation Operations
2. Grants and Ecosystem Funding
3. Protocol Upgrades
4. Protocol Parameterization
5. Emergency Protocol Operations

Importantly, The Graph Council is a starting point, not an end state. We expect it to be the seed of an evolving institution. We opted for a simple and elegant solution that was equipped to handle our short to medium-term goals of bootstrapping the network in a way that is also aligned with our long term philosophy and design principles around protocol governance.
