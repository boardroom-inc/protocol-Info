# EarthFund Boardroom Overview

EarthFund is a DAO-controlled crowdfunding platform for projects and ideas that can build a better tomorrow. It was built to give everybody a meaningful voice in the shape of their future.

We're currently building a fundraising platform on the blockchain. Decentralized and autonomous, but with all the user-friendly features of Web 2.0, EarthFund is a platform designed for mass adoption.

Once live, Earthlings will be able to join communities for causes they‚Äôre passionate about, fundraise the money they need, and vote as a collective which world-changing projects get the funding they need to make a difference.

## The path to autonomy

Our governance is broken into 5 workstreams overseeing the development of the platform and the growth of the project. Within a year of launch, the advisors will be replaced by the community, ensuring EarthFund is fully autonomous.

## Governance

Voting is handled off-chain by Snapshot. This ensures the results are verifiable and the voting process is tamper-resistant. (Votes and relayer receipts stored in IPFS). Once consensus has been reached, the result is then executed on-chain.

Proposals are created and then put for a vote. Before that, we allow for discussion and soft consensus.

## Workstreams

Having a clear, top-down hierarchy has worked pretty darn well for thousands of years. It‚Äôs allowed countries and companies to conquer the entire world.

But we don‚Äôt want to conquer the world. We want to save it. And that requires a different approach.

Think of some of mankind‚Äôs crowning achievements: flight, the discovery of DNA, the Declaration of Human Rights, vaccinations for thousands of diseases, putting Man on the moon, Sgt. Pepper‚Ä¶ 

These aren‚Äôt top-down achievements. They‚Äôre the result of free collaboration between brilliant, innovative people at the top of their game.

And that‚Äôs what we want EarthFund to be.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre working towards completely removing the idea of management. Nobody ‚Äúreports to‚Äù anybody else. Nobody has a boss or a supervisor. Instead, everybody works together in pursuit of the same goal: building a platform that helps make the world a better place.

While we‚Äôre throwing the idea of hierarchy out of the window, we still need some semblance of structure and order. (Otherwise, everything goes from flat to flat-out chaos.)

So we‚Äôve introduced workstreams.

Each workstream has complete autonomy over its work and approach. They‚Äôre close-knit teams that work together for the success of a specific area of focus. 

But, workstreams can also be thought of as mini-DAOs that form around areas of expertise. That means that sometimes, your workstreams job might overlap with another plate and call for collaboration. 

**The idea of workstreams is to give each group the autonomy and freedom to do what they do best for EarthFund.**

We‚Äôre psyched you‚Äôre thinking about joining the EarthFund team. 

Let‚Äôs make the world a better place, together.
