Bankless DAO is a decentralized community to coordinate and propagate bankless media, culture, and education. Itâ€™s goal is to drive adoption and awareness of truely bankless money systems like Ethereum, DeFi, and Bitcoin.
It achieves this goal through the collective participation of its community.

The Bankless DAO will act as a coordination mechanism for a collection of participating media nodes. Participants can range from individuals acting on their own behalf, or larger entities with employees and resources. Bankless DAO will coordinate them all in order to achieve its mission.
A new governance token called BANK will facilitate this coordination.

## Governance Process

1. Use #ðŸ§ brainstorm on Discord to share some high level ideas & signal support/against (use emojis reacts!) 
2. If there's enough signal in #ðŸ§ brainstorm, it's time to squad up! You can always do it alone but it's always better to have some help from those who are onboard with the idea. Get together some fellow DAO members & start collab'ing on the idea!
3. Once the idea is in place, draft a proposal using [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18IWZ2MwZkmh1XqGmwimiHs3bysm3LIq1ld8X2aYQpt4/edit?usp=sharing)
4. DM one of the admins & we'll spin up a separate channel with the proposal on Discord. This will act as the "thread" for proposal specific discussions. 
5. If all goes well, we'll move to a formal Snapshot vote which be open for 3 days.
