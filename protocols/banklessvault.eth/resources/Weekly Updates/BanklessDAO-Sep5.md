## Other Updates

This section of the Weekly Update is for adding anything else members of a DAO need to know. Scribes can format these however they like, but below are some suggestions on the type of things to include:

Two of the most popular channels of the DAO are:
- NFT Club, where the latest drops are discussed
- Mental Health Support, where members have a safe space to talk

The projects that have seen greater participation are:
- Website, under development, to allow all the souls of BanklessDAO to be able to communicate
- DEGEN Bot, created by BanklessDAO Devs to support many internal DAO functions
- Bounty Board, also created by BanklessDAO Devs, to organize the posting of the requested processes
- Nft platform, under study, to guarantee BanklessDAO its own dedicated platform
