## Summary

Big problems as it was discovered that someone inadvertently deleted all historical meeting notes from all guilds in Notion and what a backup and rollback would entail.

In an effort to better onboard new users a Discord how-to will be added to the first quest onboarding flow. A brief discussion on how Discord is used for programmatically refined access controls.

Review of what the current DAO Ops roles are and how they will be funded. Is anyone doing the functions already and, if not, should we be creating roles instead of letting them come to be naturally? “Happiness Manager” was one role looked at from this vantage point. What does a happiness manager do and how can their work be measured.  

The meeting ended with a discussion on how guild roles should be funded. How do you fund a small community and justify giving one person 4 points and another 2 points? And how is this done without people feeling cheated?

The book Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage in Human Consciousness was brought up as a point of interest and as it relates to the following proposed ideas:
- What if people write proposals for how much they should get. Like each person is their own startup?
- What if we allocate a pool to each role and people with that role can allocate how much they should get such that the highs and lows work together to create a free market price for a given role?
