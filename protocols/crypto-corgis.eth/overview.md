# Cryto Corgis

## Overview
Crypto corgi attributes are derived from a block number, and only the most recent 256 block numbers can be used to claim a corgi.

This means that every new block, or every 13 seconds, a new corgi is a born, and an old corgi dies.

There are 15 attributes, with a total of 213 unique features, making 3,912,209,060,760,031 possible corgis.

Some corgis are rarer than others. Watch out for the 31 unique corgis that are one-of-a-kind.

Only 10,000 corgis can be claimed.

The first corgi costs 0.001 ETH, and the last 1.001 ETH. For every block a corgi is alive, it gets discounted by 0.003 ETH from the starting price.
