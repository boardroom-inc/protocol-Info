# M^0 

M^0 is a decentralized infrastructure layer for the issuance of cryptodollar assets, empowering any institution to mint decentralized, interoperable, and fungible cryptodollars. 

It is an on-chain protocol governed by [Two Token Governance (TTG)](https://governance.m0.org/proposals/), along with a corresponding set of [off-chain standards](https://github.com/m0-foundation/adopted-guidance) and APIs, that allows holders of high-quality eligible collateral to participate in issuing a fungible cryptodollar. 

With M^0, institutions around the world can utilize turnkey middleware to become their own cryptodollar issuers, upgrading their money tech stack to the digital age"
