# Frontier DAO

FrontierDAO is an exciting new way to participate and contribute to the most truly innovative and necessary technologies of our lifetimes. Most importantly, it’s run by you, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) members. As you’ll see, becoming a member of FrontierDAO will give you exclusive access to like-minded “Bounders”—people driven to push the frontiers of science to improve the world around us and expand humankind’s knowledge.  You have already taken the most important first step to join a global movement driven not by central authorities or big businesses but you!  

# Overview

## Mission

Push the frontiers of science to make a positive impact on the world! 

It’s that simple but also incredibly hard.

FrontierDAO was born of the recognition that there exists today a need for alternate sources of funding for scientific research and innovation. This need lies primarily in the gap between government funding such as Small Business Innovation Research(SBIR) grants and private capital such as venture capitalists (VC). For the underrepresented and non-traditional researchers, entrepreneurs, scientists,and engineers, both of these status quo forms of available capital are often exclusionary and out-of-reach.  Or they come with heavy strings attached to the point of disenfranchising the Intellectual Property (IP) rights holder’s equity position in their own startup.  As an entrepreneur and a scientist-entrepreneur specialized in emerging science/technology and the potential commercialization of technology transfer, FrontierDAO founders chose to create this collectively funded, collectively sourced, open admission co-operative to address at least some of these funding needs. The goal is to open the door more widely to diverse paths of exploration in scientific research and innovation. FrontierDAO will always maintain the highest levels of integrity and transparency so you canhave full confidence in joining and contributing to this incredible community. We strongly believe the 3 most transformative technologies and industries for the next 20 years will be in space, fusion, and Web3. FrontierDAO is at the center of all 3 of these exciting areasenabled by a community-basedDAO structure. 

# Governance

## Onboarding and Governance

Communication between Bounders will primarily occur on Discord, LinkedIn, and Twitter although other platforms like Telegram, or Collab.Land are potentially available, too. NFTs are currently for sale on OpenSea and viewable on the frontierdao.xyz website and in our virtual art gallery at on cyber.io/frontierdao. 

The main FrontierDAO Discord channel is open to DAO members and non-members alike. However, an exclusive channel is reserved for DAO members that own at least one FrontierDAO NFT or at least 1000tokens. Votes on DAO Treasury distributions will occur approximately every 6 months depending on the balance in the Treasury. Each member that owns FUZN tokensis allowed to vote. The weight of each member vote is proportional to the number of tokens held.NFTs will not be allocated DAO votesbut will be able to 
whitepaper15FrontierDAO.xyzparticipate in FrontierDAO events. NFT purchasers may also receive airdropped FUZN tokens. The entranceinto this club gives you exclusive access to several exciting opportunities including:

1) Networking with worldwide science-minded Bounders.
2) Learningabout current activities and potential investments in space travel and exploration, fusion energy, climate science, and other scientific fields.
3 )Participatingin regular virtual and physical meetups.
4) Gettingexclusive talks from industry leaders in science, art, design, engineering,and entrepreneurship.

In addition, potential DAO Treasury disbursements could include:

1) Scientific research grants.
2) Space/science related entrepreneurial business grants.
3) Donation tocharitable cause in alignment with DAO mission.
4) Space tourist flight random draw.
5) Frontier NFT physical and/or virtual conference.
6) Educational opportunities for students.
7) It’s up to you!  Bring all your ideas.

As discussed above, future DAO effortswill include the issuance of FrontierDAO Tokens. This is an exciting way for people to join the DAO without buying an NFT. Individuals with limited funds can also earn tokens through community work and join the DAO by donating their time and expertise. Stay tuned for more information about token issuance,but it’s important to discuss the reasons for both a native social token and NFTs.

## Native Social Token

Our social token can be used for utility in numerous ways:  to incentivize DAO members who perform tasks and contribute their time/skills/talent to grow the DAO. It also helps to accelerate economic development with our technology offerings, allows us to invest in our own ecosystem, reward major contributions, fund development, and incentivize network participants (consumers/users). Theoretically, it can also afford us to buy naming rights to market and spread the word about FrontierDAO such as has been recently seen with sports stadiums in the U.S.

As with any endeavor, you must be truly confident that the investment you make is going to the place specified. The Founders maintain a safe multi-signature Gnosis Safe wallet with funds being fully transparent to all DAO members via quarterly reports. DAO Treasury distribution ideas will first be discussed on Discord gaining soft consensus for a subset of ideas. Those ideas will then be voted on via Snapshot or similar service.

Our DAO is set as an Open Enterprise meaning the computer code we employed to govern our DAO defines set rules for voting on proposals. There is a minimum threshold to approve a proposal for a vote; then there is a minimum number of votes, as defined by token holder votes, to approve a proposal to move forward. At least 50% of the votesare required to move forward on a proposal. 

For our NFTs,we maintain a Juicebox wallet. This is the most transparent tool available today which allows for full transparency and public tracking of all our NFT transactions. This is one of the beauties of Web3, transparency and traceability in transactions, even when it comes to royalty payouts to our contributing artists, creators,and talent network
