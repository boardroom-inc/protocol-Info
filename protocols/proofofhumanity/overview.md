# Proof of Humanity

Proof of Humanity (or PoH) is a social identity verification system for humans on Ethereum. PoH combines webs of trust, reverse Turing tests, and dispute resolution to create a sybil-proof list of humans.

## Overview

Proof of Humanity is a system combining social verification with video submission in order to create a Sybil-proof list of humans. It is meant to be used by individuals as a point-of-entry to a myriad of new use cases that require Sybil-resistance to be able to be deployed at scale and also to be plugged into a variety of existing and new applications in need for such identity systems.

### Proof of Humanity Use Cases

#### Universal Basic Income

Universal basic income (UBI) is a program for a periodic payment delivered to all individuals of a given population with no strings attached.
The Proof of Humanity registry technology enables a truly universal and fairer form of distribution for UBI projects as the only condition to receive it would be to be registered as a verified human.
A UBI project based on Proof of Humanity is already underway as a collaboration between Kleros and Democracy Earth.
Check out the [announcement of the UBI token launch](https://blog.kleros.io/proof-of-humanity-building-the-internet-of-humans/) to learn more about this.

#### Innovative DAO frameworks

DAO frameworks and apps using the PoH registry to check the “humanity” of voters can experiment with truly democratic systems (1 person = 1 vote) and innovative preferential or quadratic voting features for which Sybil-resistance is required.
For example, the UBI DAO will be based on a governance system such as this one in order to better account for the voices of every community member. A similar system could be added as a plugin to common DAO tools such as Colony, Aragon, or DAOstack.

#### Better Funding Mechanisms

By extending the concept of Quadratic Voting to a funding mechanism, one can create new mechanisms for endogenous community formation. Quadratic funding is a design for philanthropic or publicly-funded seeding to allow (near) optimal provision of a decentralized, self-organizing ecosystem of public goods.
Citizens make public goods contributions to projects of value to them. The amount received by a project is proportional to the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions received.
This mechanism requires accounts to be Sybil-resistant as splitting one’s funding across multiple accounts increases the amount given to the target project. And Proof of Humanity allows for this Sybil-resistance. Proof of Humanity can be an important piece of infrastructure to bring into reality some of the innovative governance ideas explained in the book "Radical Markets". For example, quadratic voting.

## Governance

The Kleros Protocol is fully decentralized and autonomous. Here is how to participate in its governance.
Anyone can propose changes to core contracts powering the Kleros ecosystem and all these changes need to be voted on and executed via community vote using PNK.

### Kleros Protocol Governance Process

The Kleros Protocol Governance process consists of the decision-making and enforcement process for the different changes in parameters, contract deployments, policy specifications, incentives, and improvements that make up the Kleros protocol.
Future decisions governing the protocol will be enacted through this procedure.
The PNK token empowers holders with the capability to vote on proposals and collectively act as governors of the protocol.

### Steps of a successful Kleros Improvement Proposal:

Create a KIP (Kleros Improvement Proposal) post in the "Votes" section of the [Kleros Forum](https://forum.kleros.io/).
Receive community feedback and update the KIP until it can be considered non-contentious.
Publish a new proposal on [Kleros Snapshot page](https://snapshot.page/#/kleros) to have the PNK token holders vote on it.
If the proposal is accepted, submit a list of transactions implementing the proposal(s) changes on [Kleros Governor](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/governor).
If no one successfully challenges this list, [Kleros Governor](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/governor) enacts the changes by sending the transactions.
