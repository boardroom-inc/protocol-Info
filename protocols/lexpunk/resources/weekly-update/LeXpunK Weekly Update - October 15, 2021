## Summary

Some good solid momentum this week -- feels amazing to say we are in full launch mode on our work at the DAO:

**(1) Work Product Proposals.** We have a blitz of new proposals up of staffing and the DAO legal standing working group is fully staffed and off and running! The following are currently staffing with applications due on **October 20**:

- [Guidance Paper - MiCA Commission (WG#2)](https://forum.lexpunk.army/t/staffing-notice-2-guidance-paper-regarding-mica/88) 
- [Model Foundation Structure & Forms (WG#3)](https://forum.lexpunk.army/t/staffing-notice-3-dao-model-foundation-documents/89) 
- [DAO Coop/Labor Union Model (WG#4)](https://forum.lexpunk.army/t/staffing-notice-4-model-dao-coop-labor-union/90) 
- [Token 409A Amendment](https://forum.lexpunk.army/t/staffing-notice-5-model-409a-amendment/91) 

If you are interested in being staffed, here is the process to submit an indication of interest to be staffed on a proposal:

- [Staffing Process for Proposals](https://forum.lexpunk.army/t/staffing-process-for-proposals/31) -- Our guide to applying to work on DAO projects has been updated with link to indication of interest form. 

Our priority is to get these staffed ASAP and once staffing is complete, we will set up Coordinape for the working groups, the managers will hold kick-off calls with team, set up thier work space and their intake process for research requests.

**(2) :rocket:We Haz Tokens.** :rocket:L3X were distributed to early contributers and core communities this week!   Announcement [here](https://judge-jowday.medium.com/l3x-redeploy-mint-f11003c2b29c) with an update that we went ahead and pushed them out using DefDAO funds. If you missed this round, there will be future distros to look forward to.

**(3) LeXpunK Forum Updates.** This week, we are focused on gearing up to flesh out our remaining initial proposals (copy of the proposal slate is up on our forum [here](https://forum.lexpunk.army/t/lexpunk-initial-projects-for-feedback/39)) and we are getting some engagement and thoughts on improvements and considerations as well as ideas for the next round -- keep these coming!

## Proposals

Flexing our new tokens, we put up our first item for a vote after fielding a bunch of asks -- the most pivotal question of all time: **Telegram vs. Discord** (kidding, the answer is Telegram but vote [here](https://forum.lexpunk.army/t/lexpunk-messaging-app-the-great-telegram-vs-discord-throwdown/82).)

## Forum Summary
We have been watching the crypto world come online with a flurry of policy proposals - ranging from the good (see [a16z](https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Andreessen-Horowitz-Senate-Banking-Proposals.pdf), to the generally bad and ugly (see [Coinbase](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1448714553764712451)).  
We also witnessed the divide in stances between Commissioners [Hester Peirce ](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08)and[ Crenshaw](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/crenshaw-sec-speaks-20211012) with their contrasting speeches and approach to crypto at SEC Speaks 2021.
Lots of discussion on goings on at Maker (see [here](https://thedefiant.io/makerdao-taxes-incorporation-debate/) and [here](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/14/meet-the-defi-delegate-knocking-on-the-doors-of-congress/))and the wisdom/viability of the approach being taken.
Finally, great conversation about AML/KYC (started by [Snr. Doggo's twitter convo](https://twitter.com/fubuloubu/status/1448526640129183744)) where the author of the paper he cited responded to concerns with this pretty amazing reply:
> Yup (as author of that paper) that's a fair argument - if the regulations worked. Scientists have shown fundamental flaws of #AML system for decades, even UN slammed AML failure/harm; now extending it to #cryptocurrencies; what could possibly go wrong? **#zeroimpactinfinitecost**
