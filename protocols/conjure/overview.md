# Conjure

Conjure allows anyone to create tokenized assets on Ethereum representing any asset you can imagine. The resulting Synths are fully collateralized by Ether and have their collateralization and value pegged via a powerfully flexible ability to combine multiple arbitrary price sources to produce a single reference price.

## Overviews

Conjure is permissionless (akin to Uniswap or Balancer) and permits the creation of assets representing - for example - synthetic currencies, tokens from other blockchains, real world commodities, and exotic assets such as basket currencies and indices.

## Governance

### Role

The CNJ governance organization is responsible for:

* Deploying new factory implementations for more synthetic asset types and use cases
* Approving new collateral assets for synths that users can select from
* Managing the treasury for the Conjure DAO
* Managing the token list for Conjure's dapp

### CNJ Token Distribution

CNJ is the governance token for Conjure. The initial supply of 10,000,000 CNJ will be distributed as follows:

* 20% will go to the founders, investors, and future team members, subject to vesting periods.
* 25% will be available for liquidity mining beginning in early 2021.
* 20% will be distributed to the DAO after the first liquidity mining phase in a manner determined by governance.
* 30% will be made available to the treasury over the course of 12 months, following the first allocation.
* 5% will be allocated to a community committee to help grow the community and reward contributions
