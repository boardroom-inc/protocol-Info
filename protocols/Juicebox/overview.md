# Juicebox

Juicebox allows people and communities to crowdfund their project and give their contributors a stake as community tokens (ERC20) in return. Once funds have been raised, the protocol can be leveraged to automate payments from the treasury in a controlled, transparent and decentralized fashion

## Overview

JuiceboxDAO helps people confidently run programmable and community funded treasuries from startup to scale, openly on Ethereum.

### Values

- We're builders. The decisions we make prioritize those building, and we trust those who we've delegated responsibilities to.
- We're focused. We encourage one another to focus on the commitments we've made to the DAO, and keep each other accountable to them.
- We're supportive. We're here to help, and we communicate in a way that empowers one another.
- We're listeners. We are humble with our knowledge, and seek balance between urgency and patience.
- We're honest. We are each unique selves, and we communicate our individual ideas openly and with clarity. We express ourselves and exchange feedback with this in mind.
- Weâ€™re stewards. We respect the opportunity to help set a tone for what it means to build on the open internet together.

### Focus areas

(No particular order)

#### Protocol
Define, optimize, test, monitor, and document the Juicebox protocol.

#### Community alignment
Help members of the JB community get the resources and attention they need to get started and work together.

#### Web3 ecosystem
Position JB to work with and help other public DAOs, tools, and services to safely widen opportunities for all in Web3.

#### Onboarding
Help people launch their projects on JB and build extensions to the protocol through active Q&A availability, providing useful documentation, and helping shape the information architecture of web clients.

#### Governance
Plan out how we will make decisions together as the DAO scales, and keep it accountable to its agreed upon decision-making schedule.

#### Legal
Work towards the legal clarity necessary to make JB a welcoming DAO where anyone can contribute with confidence to any focus area and get compensated for their work.

#### Data viz
Give projects rich insights into their community, and provide overview information about the JB protocol.

#### Frontend
Develop web clients for the protocol that make the user experience more empowering, reliable, and delightful over time.

#### Juicebox ecosystem
Stand up infrastructure to help projects running on the Juicebox protocol grow their decentralized communities and experiment with various treasury strategies.

#### Visibility & materials
Create and propagate digital and physical publications, stickers, art, videos, memes, and other stuff that radiate JB vibes and tell our story.

#### Dev ops
Make it as easy as possible for people to build on JB by improving processes, tooling, and documentation for all developers.

#### Mechanism
Build models and tools to analyze Juicebox project configurations. Develop and implement utilities for tokens in the Juicebox ecosystem.

#### Project Management
Regularly assess, refine, and publicly communicate the goals and progress of Juicebox DAO, contributors, and groups of contributors.

#### Membership
What does it mean to be a JuiceboxDAO member

DAO members are responsible for proposing and voting on:

* how the DAO's treasury funds are allocated.
* changes to the protocol the DAO has agreed to steward.
* changes to formal processes the DAO has agreed to follow.
* criteria for membership admission and boundaries for ragequitting.

DAO membership is required by the people and projects who raise funds on the Juicebox protocol, is given to people who are currently stewarding its focus areas, and is open to people who choose to help fund its treasury.

Membership is represented via the JBX token issued using the Juicebox protocol itself.

Members can ragequit by burning any portion of their tokens at any time and take with them a portion of the treasury's funds.

## Governance
Juicebox DAO governance runs on a 14 day cycle.

### Governance Schedule
Day 1 - Temperature Check - Saturday (00:00 UTC)
Day 4 - Snapshot Vote - Tuesday (00:00 UTC)
Day 8 - Multisig Execution - Saturday (00:00 UTC)
Day 12 - Reconfiguration Delay - Wednesday (19:19 UTC)
Day 15 / Day 1 - Funding Cycle Updated - Saturday (19:19 UTC)

### Step 0 - Discussion
Proposals can be submitted to the [Proposals Database](https://juicebox.notion.site/9d126f9148dc42ee83317d5cd74e4db4?v=50d0bbcb498044059cc0d4d83e8b13fa) at any time. Once a proposal is ready for discussion, authors can change the proposal Status from Draft to Discussion, which will automatically create a discussion thread in the Juicebox DAO [Discord Server](https://www.discord.gg/juicebox).

### Step 1 - Temperature Check
Begins on Day 1 of the Governance Cycle - Saturday 00:00 UTC

A **3-day temperature check** (react-vote Discord poll) will be created for each proposal submitted by day 1 of a Governance Cycle. During the temperature check stage, authors can update or redact their proposals based on the DAO's feedback. Proposals cannot be edited during the last 24 hours of Temperature Check (starting Monday 00:00 UTC).

**Executable proposals that have at least 10 affirmative votes amounting to 30% or more of the total votes cast will proceed to the next stage.**

### Step 2 - Offchain Voting
*Begins on Day 4 of the Governance Cycle - Tuesday 00:00 UTC*

Offchain voting is conducted on snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth. Voting must be open for at least 72 hours. Typically, voting will open on day 4 of the governance cycle and close on day 8. The DAO decides which Snapshot proposals are approved by single choice vote. Each Snapshot proposal must include the full proposal text and a link to an immutable (IPFS or Arweave) version of the proposal text.

**Proposals that have at least 66% approval and 15 or more total votes pass and are queued for execution. "Abstain" votes are not included in these counts.**

### Step 3 - Execution
*Begins on Day 7 of the Governance Cycle - Saturday 00:00 UTC*

The DAO's Gnosis multisig (mainnet: [0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e](https://etherscan.io/address/0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e)) has four days to queue the funding cycle reconfiguration.

The multisig has control over treasury decisions and certain onchain protocol parameters. The execution of JBX token holder votes depends upon the cooperation of these signers. The Juicebox DAO multisig signers have committed to executing the will of the DAO as expressed by Snapshot votes.

### Step 4 - Reconfiguration Delay
*Begins on Day 12 of the Governance Cycle - Wednesday 19:19 UTC*

The Juicebox DAO multisig must submit reconfigurations to the Juicebox DAO project at least 3 days before the start of the next funding cycle. This practice gives the DAO time to verify queued reconfigurations and proposals, and to burn their JBX tokens if desired.

### Emergency Governance Process
**Emergency governance processes** enable the DAO to act quickly in extreme circumstances. Non-standard governance measures should be reserved for crisis scenarios only.

In a crisis scenario where the DAO must take action, a 24-hour Discord poll must be created in a public thread or channel, with a message tagging @everyone. The poll must receive at least 15 affirmative votes constituting 80% of the total votes to pass. For extremely time-sensitive matters (action needed in 24 hours or less), 80% of multisig members must explicitly agree to any onchain actions.
