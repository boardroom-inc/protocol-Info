# Ideamarket 

Solving fake news by admitting uncertainty

> If Bitcoin is money without banks, Ideamarket is credibility without media corporations.

Media corporations are like central banks of narrative. In the same way that fiat currencies are valuable only because governments say they are, fiat narratives are true only because media corporations say they are.

> Credibility means answering the question "Whose opinions deserve trust?
## Overview

**Ideamarket is an experiment in:**
* accepting every opinion on every topic
* tracking changes of opinion over time
* letting the public decide whose opinions deserve trust

### How it works

The court of public opinion has 3 main parts:
- **Posts** are Ideamarket-native NFTs. As increasing numbers of influential people rate a post, it may become a cultural artifact (like a baseball signed by many MLB players). You will be able to sell the posts you create on OpenSea. 

- **Rate posts on a scale of 1-100, on-chain.** Ratings create a permanent track record of public opinion. This makes it easy to see who had good judgment in the past. Edit your ratings at any time, but the history of your edits will be on-chain.

- **Stake IMO on a Judge to increase their impact on the IMO Rating of every post they rate.**  IMO rating is the big colorful number on the homepage. Staking involves no risk of capital loss — it's just voting at this point (or delegated proof of stake for information management). No need to buy IMO first — just click the "Stake" button and spend AETH, and we'll convert it for you in our smart contracts.

Unlike the declarations made by media corporations, Ideamarket's IMO Ratings are
* provably fair
* fast-iterating, and
* backed by skin-in-the-game

## Token

$IMO is Ideamarket's utility and governance token, launched on 2/2/2022. It stands for "in my opinion" because opinions are all we have.

### Utility
Stake IMO on users you trust to boost their ratings. The more IMO staked on a user, the more that user’s ratings affect the Composite Rating of every post they rate.

Soon we'll introduce Bounties, a way for users to crowdsource prizes for celebrity opinions. Bounties will be paid in $IMO, so that the people whose opinions the public values most will have a stake in the Ideamarket ecosystem.
