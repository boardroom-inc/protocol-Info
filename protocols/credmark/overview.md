On August 30th Credmark published its
[Roadmap to Decentralization](https://blog.credmark.com/roadmap-to-decentralization-b832b1eaf646). The
roadmap shows us starting Governance Staking in year 2. We're going to
get there a heck of a lot faster. 

All of our work at Credmark is incremental and deliberate. We build,
deploy, analyze, and restart the cycle. That's how we're going to get
to full decentralization. 

Expect to see a simple voting system in place here soon. As soon as
something minimal is operational, we'll start asking the community to
vote on proposals. As we learn we'll get more sophisticated. 

Ultimate goal is complete decentralization.
