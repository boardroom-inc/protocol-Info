## Overview
### Why Bacon?
Almost everyone has heard the phrase “Bring home the bacon,” which roughly means to “earn the money that is needed to live.” Purchasing bHOME allows anyone with a crypto wallet to access the same asset class used by banks and governments to preserve and grow their wealth.

### Intro
Mortgages have been a cornerstone of our financial systems and have been around since the year 1190. Banks, insurance companies, and governments buy and hold trillions of dollars of mortgages each year to preserve and grow wealth.

The U.S. government holds over $3 Trillion of mortgages. Ever wonder where the interest comes from in a savings account? Well banks use your money and lend it out to home owners. They then share a very small percentage of the payments they get with you. Generally this is about 0.1% from the 3% they collect from homeowners.

The Bacon Protocol introduces a new way for crypto wallet holders to hold a coin backed by the same types of mortgages that banks, insurance companies and governments use. Because of the efficiency of the blockchain and the removal of all the processes and many people, users of the Bacon Protocol get the majority of the return, about 2 - 3% vs 0.1% if you kept that money in a savings account.

bHOME, our first token, is backed by liens against homes in the United States and grows based on payments from the loans made against these liens.

### Bacon Protocol

The Bacon Protocol brings the same power and value that mortgages give banks,
financial institutions, and governments to anyone who can buy cryptocurrency. No
matter where you live, you can purchase the bHOME coin and enjoy the stability of
mortgages backed by real homes and receive benefits from interest payments on
those mortgages.

The Bacon Protocol is a decentralized system built using smart contracts on the
Ethereum blockchain. Anyone with a crypto wallet can lend money and earn interest
and most importantly, see exactly which homes they are lending against. Anyone
with a home that meets the protocol’s criteria can create an NFT and use it as
collateral to borrow USDC.

The Bacon Protocol has several important pieces:

*Pans* — smart contracts that pool funds, mint the bHome coin and fund loans
that match the Pan’s criteria.
*bHOME* — the first of many expected Bacon-based Stable+ Coins.
*Eggs* — NFTs that hold information about the home and represent real value in
the home
*BACON* — a governance token that controls the parameters and structure of the
protocol

## Governance

The Bacon Protocol will have a corresponding governance token, BACON. Over time,
as the Bacon Protocol and its community grow, control and governance of the
protocol will be decentralized. Voting by the BACON token holders will drive all
major policy decisions.

Governance through BACON may have these functions, control of the protocol, and
other rights and responsibilities that the creators and community decide:
. Creation of new Pans
. Adjustment of AMM parameters
. Changes to protocol behavior
. Allocation of liquidity incentives
. Usage of treasury funds
. Bonding for servicers

Early bHOME liquidity providers will be given BACON as a reward for helping to
bootstrap the protocol. That group that receives BACON for their participation in the
protocol will form the core of the community and decentralized governance.

Other utility functions are being considered for BACON. These include access to
broader data for large holders and the ability to propose the creation of new Pans.
