## Governance

Anyone can start a discussion that might lead into a improvement to the underlying protocol. The road to a successful BIP (B.Protocol Improvement Proposal) is usually broken into the following parts.

1. **Discussion or idea**

    At the idea or discussion stage anyone is open to bring up and issue or improvement they think can help the protocol. It can be an informal discussion without the need for technical details or specifics. These ideas and discussions are open to creativity and work as a temperature check.

2. **BIP (B.Protocol Improvement Proposal)**

    If a discussion leads into something specific that can improve the protocol it can be formulated as a BIP. a BIP is one or more actions that can be executed that affects the protocol. Typically a BIP can include an intro, rationale/reasoning, timeline, impacts and actions.

3. **Snapshot**

    Once a BIP has matured to the stage of running it as a vote, it is published on Snapshot, where the DAO (BPRO holders) are able to vote on the proposal. If the proposal reaches quorum, it will be executed on chain.
