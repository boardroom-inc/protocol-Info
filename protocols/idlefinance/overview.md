**Idle is a decentralized protocol dedicated to bringing automatic asset allocation and yield aggregation to the interest-bearing tokens economy.**

This protocol bundles crypto-assets (ETH, WBTC, and stablecoins) into tokenized baskets that are programmed to automatically rebalance funds according to different management strategies. Every allocation strategy has its own set of tokens representing a pool of yield-generating assets spread across different DeFi protocols.

Currently, Idle uses two different allocation strategies:

-   **Best-Yield**: this strategy combines multiple money markets to automatically provide the highest interest rates, beating the best traditional offerings across interest-bearing tokens and DeFi protocols.    
-   **Risk-Adjusted**: this strategy automatically changes the asset allocation to find the optimal mix between risk scores and yield.
	
Consequently, users can hold IdleTokens related to a specific strategy and a specific asset.

### DAO Structure

#### TopDAO - Idle Governance

The Idle protocol is governed by a TopDAO (the Idle Governance) represented by $IDLE token holders.

The DAO directs and manages the strategic decisions of the protocol through the IIPs (Idle Improvement Proposals), enabling community participants to contribute to the protocol’s future developments.

The Idle Governance promotes key activities to ensure a proper protocol’s maintenance and improvements in the years to come.

#### SubDAOs - Idle Leagues

In May 2021, the community voted to establish the SubDAOs (Idle Leagues), autonomous teams that focus on one area of expertise and take care of the daily protocol maintenance, propose new ideas, interact with the crypto ecosystem and execute decisions taken by the Governance.

The Idle Governance (TopDAO) has the power to allocate economic resources and assign tasks to the Idle Leagues. Through snapshot polls, the Governance can assign/revoke the budget to the subDAO at any time or stop financing it, and can elect/remove their members in charge for the mandate duration (currently 3 months).

#### How to get in touch with Leagues

The community is welcome to get in touch and bounce ideas with Idle Leagues through different community channels. You can ask for Treasury League members for new initiatives, Dev League for tech inquiries, or participate in the governance process in the forum:

* [Discord](https://discord.gg/mpySAJp)
* [Telegram](https://t.me/idlefinance)
* [Governance Forum](https://gov.idle.finance)

If you are looking to contribute as a developer, you can [apply for the Open Applications with the Dev League here](https://www.notion.so/idlelabs/Dev-League-Application-Process-7c07d8544a74494985fecadf2d58f829).

### Governance Process

Any proposal, idea or initiative for the Idle protocol that is proposed by a community member should go through several steps:

| Idea Discussion        | Community members can propose early stage ideas in the [“Governance-Meta”](https://gov.idle.finance/c/Governance-Meta) or [“New Features & Improvements”](https://gov.idle.finance/c/New-Features-Improvements/5) category and receive initial feedback.                                                                                                                    | 2+ days  | [Governance Forum](https://gov.idle.finance/)                       |
| Temperature check      | Create the associated Snapshot poll (off-chain action) of the idea proposed in the previous phase. The aim is to taste the sentiment of the community about a potential change. Users need to hold 100 IDLE as voting power to submit a Snapshot poll.                                                                                                                      | 3 days   | [Snapshot page](https://snapshot.page/#/idlefinance.eth/)           |
| Proposal Formalization | After getting a consensus in the previous phase, once the idea is more structured and has the form of a proposal, the initial proposer or a community member may decide to submit the idea as an IIP in the [“Proposals” category](https://gov.idle.finance/c/proposals/6)                                                                                                  | 2+ days  | [Governance Forum](https://gov.idle.finance/)                       |
| On-chain proposal      | The proposer or other people can deploy on-chain the official proposal, that is broadcasted as executable code. It starts its journey in a pending state. Once the on-chain proposal is active, IDLE token holders cast their vote “For” or “Against”. Users can follow [this guide](https://gov.idle.finance/t/guide-how-to-propose-an-iip/45) to learn how to create IIPs | 3 days   | [Governance Dashboard](https://idle.finance/#/governance/proposals) |

**What is an IIP (Idle Improvement Proposals)?**
An IIP could be an idea, a need, an update, a novelty, all related to Idle
in the form of an on-chain proposal that, after being discussed 
and with a reached consensus agreement, can be voted on by DAO members.

**Who can submit proposals on-chain?**
Every address with at least 130,000 $IDLE can submit on-chain proposals.  
At any stage, the proposal can be cancelled only by its creator.

**When a proposal is executed on-chain?**
The quorum to execute any change on the protocol is 520,000 $IDLE 
and an IIP is executed if the majority (50% +1) of the voters cast a “For” vote.

**Who can vote on-chain?**
Every user that holds IDLE can vote, but to get the eligibility before voting
they must self-delegate or delegate to others their voting rights.
