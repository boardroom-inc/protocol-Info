# What is BFT DAO?

**BFT DAO is the voice of BFT holders. BFT Token holders govern the BFT DAO. We use https://www.boardroom.info/ to create, discuss and vote on proposals. We are working hand in hand with the centralised organisation bnktothefuture to bring bnktothefuture to the masses. Bnktothefuture can outsource jobs to the BFT DAO through bft bounties.**

Here are a few examples of what BFT Token holders and the BFT DAO could control:
* How to improve BFT utility
* Which products or services to build.
* implement any other ideas contributed by our customers and community

BFT hodlers are encouraged to engage—discuss and debate ideas, brainstorm the optimal path forward, suggest a route change to the roadmap.

# Current Governance Model

The BFT DAO is powered by SafeSnap (SnapShot + Gnosis Safe), which means community members can propose and vote on proposals with zero gas fees, and the result of those votes can trigger on-chain transactions.

Voting power applies to those with BFT in their wallets and will soon be upgraded to include BFT in the BFT/ETH Liquidity Pool on Uniswap V2.
Initial governance parameters are as follows:
* 1000 BFT required to submit a proposal
* 90% relative vote support to reach quorum
* 72-hour minimum voting period

These parameters are subject to change via BFT DAO governance proposals.

Initially, we can implement a multisig safeguard controlled by bnktothefuture employees alongside SafeSnap to mitigate the risk of a malicious proposal stealing funds from the DAO’s treasury. This would be intended as a temporary protective measure and transition to complete control of the treasury to the community of BFT token holders.
