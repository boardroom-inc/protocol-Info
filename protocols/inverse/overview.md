# Inverse Finance

Inverse Finance is a suite of permissionless decentralized finance tools governed by Inverse DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization running on the Ethereum blockchain.
# Overview

The main Inverse Finance products are Anchor and DOLA stablecoin.
Anchor is a money market and synthetic asset protocol enabling capital efficient borrowing & lending.
DOLA is a stablecoin token that tracks the price of $1. DOLA can be minted by using other assets on Anchor as collateral and can also be used itself as collateral to borrow other assets on Anchor.
INV Token, the governance token has additional functionality to be used as a collateral asset in anchor.
Inverse Finance is governed and run by its community of token holders (numbering over 2000 holders) and elected delegates. 
# Governance

## Community

INV holders gain voting rights on proposals being put forward to GovernorMills. The Inverse Finance community will discuss and debate the proposals before they  go on-chain, using our official Discord and Forum. Please use the links below to access both:

## Inverse DAO

Inverse Finance and its products are governed by a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) called the Inverse DAO, that governs using on-chain voting on Ethereum. INV and xINV token holders can delegate their votes to themselves and vote each time, or save gas fees by delegating their voting power to another delegate. 1 INV = 1 vote.
To see your wallets voting power, go to the [Governance page](https://www.inverse.finance/governance).

The Inverse DAO controls a number of aspects of the Inverse Finance universe and products, including but not limited to:
* The INV governance token 
* The Inverse DAO treasury (INV tokens, Anchor profits and PoL, Protocol owned Liquidity)
* Inverse DAO parameters (proposal threshold, guardian)
* Anchor Banking parameters (fees, collateral ratios, liquidation parameters etc)
* Anchor Stabilizer parameters (fees, debt ceiling).

### Execution of Proposals

Once a proposal is submitted (1000 votes needed to submit a proposal on-chain), voting lasts for a period of 3 days. To "pass", the proposal requires a minimum of 4000 FOR votes, and to have more FOR votes than AGAINST votes.

Once a proposal has passed, it must be queued on-chain. This action can be triggered by anyone who is willing to pay the gas fee (usually done by a DAO member). The proposal then enters a lockdown period of 48 hours (to let people prepare for the consequences of the proposal once executed).

After the lockdown period, the proposal's execution can be triggered by anyone (who is willing to pay the gas transaction cost) within 14 days. If the proposal is not executed within 14 days, it will expire and is no longer actionable.

## Voting

### How does it work?

Anyone can create and submit proposals, meaning they request specific changes to be made to the protocol.  Delegates and individuals within the INV and xINV holder community vote on whether to execute the proposal or not. If the proposal is accepted, then the changes will be implemented.

### How to vote on proposals?

When a proposal has been submitted to the Inverse Dao, you can find the vote [here](https://www.inverse.finance/governance). As voting is on-chain, you will need to pay the Ethereum gas fee for the transaction if you have not delegated to someone else.

To be eligible to vote, you need to have done one of two things prior to the proposal going live:

* [Delegate your INV vote to another delegate](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/governance/delegates-and-delegating) (someone else).

* Self-Delegate
