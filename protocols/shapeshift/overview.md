**ShapeShift is a borderless, cross-chain crypto trading platform and portfolio manager for user self-sovereignty. FOX Token holders govern the ShapeShift DAO and can vote to allocate the treasury of FOX and any revenues generated by the ShapeShift ecosystem.**

Here are a few examples of what FOX Token holders and the ShapeShift DAO can control today:
- Which protocols and assets to integrate. 
- How to spend or invest funds in the ShapeShift DAO, such as:
  - Funding community initiatives like liquidity mining, Rainfall, FOX Fuel, and FOX rewards or other new initiatives.
  - Which products or services to build.
  - Hiring contractors to build those products or services (and selecting those hired).
- Whether to add or change fees for using the ShapeShift interface (currently, ShapeShift does not add any fees but has the capability to turn these on). Examples of this today include: fees on 0x trades, fees on THORChain trades, fees on LP tx’s through THORChain, and fees on fiat purchases through Banxa.
- And any other ideas contributed by our customers and community.

FOX hodlers are encouraged to engage—discuss and debate ideas, brainstorm the optimal path forward, suggest a route change to the roadmap. Join the discord at [discord.gg/shapeshift](https://discord.gg/shapeshift) and the forum at [forum.shapeshift.com](https://forum.shapeshift.com), where we will focus all open discussion and communications for the decentralized community. 

The ShapeShift DAO is powered by SafeSnap (SnapShot + Gnosis Safe), which means community members can propose and vote on proposals with zero gas fees, and the result of those votes can trigger on-chain transactions. 

Voting power applies to those with FOX in their wallets and will soon be upgraded to include FOX in the FOX/ETH Liquidity Pool on Uniswap V2. 

Initial governance parameters are as follows:

- 100 FOX required to submit a proposal (0.00000001% of FOX supply)
- 0.4% of FOX supply required to vote to reach quorum (4,000,000 FOX)
- 90% relative vote support to reach “soft quorum”
- 72-hour minimum voting period

These parameters are subject to change via ShapeShift DAO governance proposals.

Initially, a multisig safeguard controlled by ShapeShift employees has been implemented alongside SafeSnap to mitigate the risk of a malicious proposal stealing funds from the DAO’s treasury. This is intended as a temporary protective measure, and we look forward to working with the community to transition complete control of the treasury to the community of FOX token holders. Verification of the identities and integrity of the ShapeShift employees comprising the multisig keys can be provided to security researchers upon request.
