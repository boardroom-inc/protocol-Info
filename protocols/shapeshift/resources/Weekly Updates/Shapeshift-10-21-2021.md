## Summary

The DAOis on a poap pause in order to stop the poap farms from snatching them all up. A new bot is being set up to prevent this going forward. 
Some leadership changes as far as who controls Colony, the DAOs operation system, are in discussion.

### Newly Passed Proposals

All three of the active proposals from last week's governance call passed.

1. Proposed Roadmap through December 2021 from @CAO with almost ten million votes. 
2. Integrate OnJuno for Onramps and Offramps and have the DAO earn revenue via its partner program from @CAO
3. Launch of Stable FOX ($oneFOX) from @Bryan ICHI

A fourth proposal was added and passed to create 10 “Creatures of Cryptozoology” crypto animal-themed NFTs, creatively telling the history of crypto over the years through these animals. These will be awarded to the ShapeShift DAO treasury for resale/auction as income potential. A few of the animals I may include are: unicorn, bear whale, honey badger, alpaca, shibu, bear, bull…all the fun animals. This proposal will include 10 custom animal-themed digital art pieces, each individually minted and transferred to the Shapeshift DAO. Each piece will be uniquely it's own and share the history of cryptocurrency through these 10 animals. These pieces will be the DAO’s to auction off, sell or hold onto as they see fit for the greatest benefit of the DAO. You can see more from this artist [here](https://opensea.io/collection/shapeshiftdaonfts).

There are two active proposals and some unusual circumstances around. The Pendo proposal is the first one that has had almost equal votes for and against it. The chief concern as brought up by @nerdhair is that the integration of Pendo allows for an XSS attack.

The motivation behind the second proposal is to remove sell pressure on the DAOs native token, FOX.

### Active Proposals

| Summary | Description |
| --- | --- |
Should ShapeShift implement Pendo, an all-in-one product analytics, and user guidance tool, for mobile and web? | This is a [proposal to implement Pendo](https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6c2hhcGVzaGlmdDpkZWZhdWx0OnFtcW5xMTM5eXlmeWFqdmZhcTc5a2hibHJqdnVtcTk4a3JoN3U1dGV2bm5kcWs=) on the ShapeShift web app and mobile app. Pendo is an all-in-one tool that combines analytics and user guidance into one platform.
ShapeShift DAO x 1Hive Partnership (FOX/HNY LP) | ShapeShift DAO and 1Hive DAO will execute a community swap of approximately $100,000 in equivalence of FOX and HNY (1Hive’s native token). Two DAOs partnering to provide liquidity is extremely powerful, especially when the culture and motives are aligned.
