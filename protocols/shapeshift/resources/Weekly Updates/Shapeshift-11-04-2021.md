## Summary

There is a POAP backlog that is being addressed but if you have interest in NFTs and community engagement, feel free to hop into the Shapeshift Discord to lend a helping hand.

### Newly Passed Proposals

The proposal to the DAO regarding receipt of ShapeShift Cards (SHAPESHIFTCD) from @willyfox passed! ü•≥

The 16 cards that were some of the earliest NFTs (circa 2015) minted by Spells of Genesis and given to ShapeShift for supporting their early blockchain-based game development. These could end up being some of the rarest and most historical NFTs ever. Will unlock over the next 2 years in 3 tranches (5 available immediately, 5 that cannot be moved for 1 year, and 6 that cannot be moved for 2 years). Whether the DAO sells these NFTs for ETH, holds them for the long term, or some combination thereof they will become a valuable and important asset in the ShapeShift DAO treasury.

### Active Proposals

There is only one active proposal at this point and it is a proposal to elect Diggy as Product Workstream leader for 4 months. 
Proposer: @Diggy
Total Proposed Budget: N/A
Job Description written up by CAO, Willyfox, and Diggy
4-month role through the end of Feb 22. 
Senior UX Manager on the Product Team with centralized ShapeShift for two and a half years, and previously was Director of UX at different organizations for over 7 years. Will split UX responsibilities with @beard
