## Summary

Shapeshift had its 13th weekly governance call and it's incredible to look back and see what has been accomplished over the past three months.

Over the next several weeks, we will be interviewing proposal writers to get the story behind the story and post those here for benefit of our readers.

Keep an eye on Shapeshift governance tracker [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQ_JXyAyMX0yH_ldx0JicRDKp5s3lFXh5gaEer6LKGQ/edit#gid=585211365)!

### Newly Passed Proposals

| Summary | Proposer | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
[Commission to create 10 “Creatures of Cryptozoology” NFTs for the ShapeShift DAO Treasury](https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6c2hhcGVzaGlmdDpkZWZhdWx0OnFtYWptY3htcnFodG5lcWZ6ZDh6NmMzZWR1eHBqamNpeHJlNzdrZ2JyeGhlaHA=) | @_lunahawk | Proposal to create 10 “Creatures of Cryptozoology” crypto animal-themed NFTs to be awarded to the ShapeShift DAO treasury for resale/auction as an income potential. Animals potentially included are: unicorn, bear whale, honey badger, alpaca, shibu, bear, bull, etc. 10% commission on secondary sales into the NFT contracts (via OpenSea). 1/2 of the proceeds will go back to the DAO when it sells and/or resells for the lifetime of the NFT. |
[ShapeShift DAO x 1Hive Partnership (FOX/HNY LP)](https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6c2hhcGVzaGlmdDpkZWZhdWx0OnFtcnB3emt2Z2dqZ2p2a2pyNGZkc3lwbG1rdmo2Y2k3a3Z5OGd0dzNhZGd4MXI=) | @LPX @monstrosity @kyle_stargarden | DAO2DAO Collaboration/Joint Venture. ~350 HNY swapped for ~665K FOX through a six sig multisig between DAOs. When the 2nd vote passes on 1Hive DAO, 350 HNY will be unlocked and sent to provide liquidity. Liquidity will then be added to the HNY+FOX pool — 50% of the resulting LP tokens would be sent to ShapeShift DAO’s treasury and the other 50% to 1Hive DAO’s treasury. The resulting liquidity would be approximately $400K on the xDAI network with $2.5K split between the 3 Organizer/coordinator/planners |
[Addendum to Proposal [SCP-25] the FOX Bond program through OlympusDAO](https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6c2hhcGVzaGlmdDpkZWZhdWx0OnFteGp5Zzc2OHZmdTl4aGd4cXN1cHFlZXduZXU2cW9heXM2aHZwa2hhZHJ0b3c=) | @Ron | Addendum to SCP-25, creating a committee to be able to make changes to FOX bond reward amount on behalf of the DAO under predefined guidelines. Better capitalize on the demand of these FOX bonds and to acquire more DAO-owned liquidity and do so at an appropriate rate. Votes on specifications in forum post here. Allows for a better reaction to market conditions for the bonds vs having to go through the lengthy, 10-day minimum, governance process currently in place. |

### Active Proposals

| Summary | Proposer | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
Proposal to the DAO regarding receipt of ShapeShift Cards (SHAPESHIFTCD) | @willyfox | 16 cards that were some of the earliest NFTs (circa 2015) minted by Spells of Genesis and given to ShapeShift for supporting their early blockchain-based game development. These could end up being some of the rarest and most historical NFTs ever. Will unlock over the next 2 years in 3 tranches (5 available immediately, 5 that cannot be moved for 1 year, and 6 that cannot be moved for 2 years). Whether the DAO sells these NFTs for ETH, holds them for the long term, or some combination thereof they will become a valuable and important asset in the ShapeShift DAO treasury. |
