KeeperDAO is building a decentralized protocol for Keepers that will help make Ethereum a more secure, egalitarian, and profitable network for all.

### Governance

KeeperDAO introduced and leverages a novel Governance model which supports an ideal model: efficiency for agreeable Proposals while scaling friction with Proposal risk and complication.
One of the promises of blockchain is total decentralisation. KeeperDAO upholds this promise by developing an egalitarian governance structure. The governance mechanism echoes the central values of KeeperDAO â€” equality, fairness, innovation, and security.

As part of this new governance structure, ROOK token holders play an integral role in the future of KeeperDAO. As we move towards complete decentralization, voters make the decisions related to new features, treasury funds, and rules for stakeholders.
