# Dope Wars

The DOPE WARS community is producing one of the first play-to-earn crypto games on the Ethereum and StarkWare blockchain, inspired by the classic TI-83 game we played instead of doing math homework.

DOPE WARS is also an ongoing NFT art project and experiment in decentralized project governance using a DAO.

## DAO Governance & Compensation

To fund the DOPE DAO treasury DOPE WARS has established a 5% royalty payment on each sale, held by the DAO until released by community vote.

Community members draft proposals to use these funds on projects that are then voted on by DOPE NFT holders. This governance structure is how DOPE WARS is able to continue building the DOPE WARS ecosystem with a loose collection of shifting contributors.

### DAO Proposal Review Process

DOPE DAO will check the following before considering any and all proposals.

**Personnel**

- Are you credible?
- Are you qualified to do this work?
- Are any connections you claim to have real?

**Technical**

- Does the proposal make sense technically?
- Does this fit into, or compliment other projects in the Dope Wars ecosystem?

**Timeline**

- 5 business day discussion and voting period
- Members can vote to extend another 5 business days, up to two times
- Vote passes or fails

**Other Considerations**

- DOPE WARS requires 10% participation to achieve quorum, required for decisions to be valid
- If no consensus, then proposal fails
- Sponsor is responsible for evaluating the milestone along with a community appointed witness, also a DOPE NFT holder
