What is DefiDollar ($DUSD)?[](https://docs.dusd.finance/#what-is-defidollar-dusd)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DefiDollar (DUSD) is a stablecoin that uses DeFi primitives to stay close to the dollar mark. DUSD provides an avenue for diversifying your stablecoin holdings to hedge against an event where the underlying stablecoins e.g Tether (USDT), DAI deviate from their peg.‚Äå DUSD is collateralised by [Curve Finance](https://www.curve.fi/) LP tokens. For more details, please refer to our introduction blog [here](https://medium.com/defidollar/a-curvy-defidollar-c249438c154a).

Why use DUSD?[](https://docs.dusd.finance/#why-use-dusd)

------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Risk diversification: Diversify your stablecoin portfolio by owning a meta asset, backed by multiple stablecoins.

2.  Volatility cushion: DUSD comes with a native staking mechanism that cushions the day-to-day stablecoin deviations from their peg.

3.  Modularity: DUSD is built with modularity in mind. It is super easy to integrate with DUSD smart contracts and hence help in driving wider adoption of the DefiDollar protocol.

4.  Yield farming: Earn yield rewards by staking and adding DUSD liquidity to various DEXs and DeFi Protocols. The specifics of the reward distribution will be announced soon.
