How do I mint DUSD?[](https://docs.dusd.finance/interacting-with-dusd#how-do-i-mint-dusd)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Select assets: Currently you can use either of DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD or a combination of those to mint DUSD. In case you want to mint using multiple assets click on "Add more tokens". You can also use yCRV & yUSD directly to mint DUSD. This operation is also very gas efficient and doesn't incur a fee.

-   Approve assets: You have to approve the coins before you can initiate the mint transaction. Single approval is needed if one coin is selected and multiple if otherwise.

-   Initiate minting: Post granting approvals click on the "Mint" button and confirm the transaction, upon the transaction getting mined on-chain your DUSD balance will be reflected in your wallet and on the web-app. We currently support the sUSD pool on Curve, once we add more peaks, support for additional stablecoins such as sUSD, BUSD, PAX etc can be added.

How do I Stake / Unstake my DUSD?[](https://docs.dusd.finance/interacting-with-dusd#how-do-i-stake-unstake-my-dusd)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Staking is currently disabled!

Stakers contribute to the overall security of the DUSD ecosystem and are rewarded for bearing risk. They are also eligible to claim the protocol income generated: trading fee and lending interest from the underlying protocols. We launched the protocol with staking enabled via DUSD , on collecting data points since launch we decided to revamp the staking mechanism. Staking will be enabled via DefiDollar's governance token - DFD. We are currently evaluating a hybrid model that can having staking via a combination of DFD and DUSD to have a more robust protocol.
