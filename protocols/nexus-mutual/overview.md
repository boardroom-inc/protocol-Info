# Nexus Mutual

## Overview

People can join the mutual and become members. Members can buy cover to protect against material losses when transferring funds into a protocol’s smart contracts or keeping funds with a custodian. Nexus Mutual is a discretionary mutual. Each member can hold NXM tokens, which represent proportional ownership of the mutual. The mutual runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

Things our members can do;

- Buy discretionary cover products.
- Contribute funds to the mutual and hold NXM tokens.
- Share risk with other members.
- Act as [Risk Assessors](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/how-to-use-nexus/how-to-participate#risk-assessment).
- Act as [Claims Assessors](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/how-to-use-nexus/how-to-participate#claims-assessment).
- Put forward governance proposals.
- Vote on proposals put forward by the team or other members.

### Things the Nexus Mutual team has developed and generally instigates discussion on:

_Note: All of these items are open to any member to develop and champion as they wish._

[**Base pricing**](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/docs#pricing)
This has been calculated by insurance experts, actuaries and advisors based on centuries of actuarial economics.
Investments
This feature will be used to maximise return on the pool of funds in the mutual.
Product development
Based on feedback from the community, progression of the Ethereum and DeFi ecosystem and the capacity/expertise of the team.

### Things our members are responsible for:

**Governance**
Members are encouraged to vote on proposals or put forward their own proposals.

**Capital provision**
Members pay a nominal fee for membership and also contribute into the capital pool by either contributing funds directly but also by purchasing cover products.

**Risk assessment**
Members can stake against the security of a protocol or custodian and get rewarded for their staking. Enough staking needs to happen before anyone can purchase cover on a protocol and/or custodian.
Staking Risks: Staking with Nexus Mutual is more knowledge-based than with other DeFi systems and therefore should be undertaken only by members who are prepared to risk losing their stake if there is a successful claim. It should be considered as active rather than passive staking.
Members voted to change the staking system for Risk Assessors to a pooled staking system, which allows assessors to claim rewards weekly in an effort to reduce gas costs.

**Claims assessment**
When Nexus Mutual is alerted to a claim, members can evaluate claims and earn NXM rewards for positive, honest contributions to the Claims Assessment process. These members stake NXM, discuss the validity of a claim, review a variety of data and determine whether to pay out on a claim or not through a vote.
A cool-down period of 72-hours takes effect after a loss event occurs. Once the cool-down period ends, claims can be submitted for evaluation. Claims should be resolved within 12-48 hours after they are submitted.

### The token

The NXM token represents membership rights in the mutual, with all members owning the mutual together in proportion to their individual NXM holdings.

It runs on a [bonding curve](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/docs#token-model) which is a mathematical curve that defines the relationship between price and token supply.

It can only be bought and sold through the Nexus Mutual application. Only members of Nexus Mutual can hold NXM tokens.

## Governance

By using the UK’s discretionary mutual model, Nexus Mutual strives to be a decentralised alternative to insurance. As such, members are responsible for participating in governance to determine the future of the mutual, which allows the mutual model to adopt the ethos of a decentralised public blockchain.

### What You Do

All members of the mutual can vote on proposals. They can also submit new proposals to be voted on by the membership base.

All proposals put to a member vote are firstly put to the Advisory Board (described below), who will white-list the proposal and make a recommendation on the outcome. Members are then given a specified time-frame to vote on the proposal. If a specified quorum is met, then the majority outcome prevails. If a specified quorum is not met, then the vote proceeds as per the Advisory Board recommendation.

As a reward for participating in the governance process, all voting members will be awarded a share of additional NXM tokens that are generated for each proposal (chosen by the Advisory Board within limits). Additionally, any member may delegate their vote to any other member, allowing them to rely on a fellow member they believe has more expertise than themselves. In this case, the delegating member continues to earn all the voting rewards.

Voting on a governance proposal (including via the delegation process) prevents a member from redeeming their tokens from the mutual for the following seven days. This lock-in period was introduced to ensure that voting Members are affected by the decisions they make.

### Advisory Board

In an ideal world, all potential actions can be defined by the code. However, reality is much more complex and a fall-back option is required in several circumstances. As such, an Advisory Board will be set up to facilitate interaction with the real world, as well as act on behalf of the mutual in some of the more extreme scenarios.

The Advisory Board has no custodial rights over the fund pool and cannot release funds to any particular person. A member is able to submit a proposal to nominate themselves to replace any member of the existing Advisory Board; such a proposal will bypass the whitelisting process meaning it cannot be stopped by the Advisory Board.

As mentioned above, the Board will also whitelist member governance proposals in order to highlight important ones and reduce clutter. There are certain types of proposals which do not require Board whitelisting (e.g. replacing members of the Advisory Board).

### Grant application process

Members that wish to contribute can submit a grant proposal. The proposal process is described below. Once a proposal is discussed and listed for a Snapshot vote, the community will decide on whether or not to accept the proposal.
