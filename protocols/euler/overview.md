# Euler

Democratising the assets people can lend and borrow.
-Euler is a non-custodial protocol on Ethereum that allows users to lend and borrow almost any crypto asset.

## Overview

Euler is a capital-efficient permissionless lending protocol that helps users to earn interest on their crypto assets or hedge against volatile markets without the need for a trusted third party.
Euler features a number of innovations not seen before in DeFi, including permissionless lending markets, reactive interest rates, protected collateral, MEV-resistant liquidations, multi-collateral stability pools, and much more. For more information, read the Euler White Paper at https://docs.euler.xyz/getting-started/white-paper.

## Governance

### EUL

Euler Protocol will be managed in the long-term by a decentralised community of custodians. Custodians are holders of a protocol native governance token called Euler (EUL). Tokens can be used to propose upgrades to the protocol or vote on the proposals of others. EUL tokens represent voting shares. Custodians can vote on proposals directly or delegate their votes to a third party.
