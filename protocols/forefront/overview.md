Forefront (FF) DAO is the port-of-entry to social clubs and digital cities. FF is the premier social token community, creating and curating resources and spaces to help tokenized communities thrive. 
These resources will onboard the next wave of Web3 alchemists and world-builders. 

### Governance

The governance of FF DAO is managed via Snapshot and Gnosis. All treasury tokens will be transferred using FFDAO Snapshot proposals, with future ambitions to move to an on-chain DAO at the choosing of FF holders. 
Treasury tokens are used at the discretion of the community, and may be allocated to any and all programs that add value to the Forefront ecosystem.

## Overview

Forefront governance happens in three phases:

1. **Discord.** New ideas, changes, and projects will be proposed in the relevant Discord channels. At this stage, conversation can happen to flesh things out and establish soft consensus.
2. **Forum.** If consensus is reached, a formal proposal can be posted to the FF Forum. The community can then engage in more concrete discussions around the specifics of the proposal, and any necessary changes can be made.
3. **Snapshot.** Once a proposal has been adequately discussed on the Forum, we will hold a community-wide off-chain vote on Snapshot to determine whether or not the proposal will go into effect.

Governance is an ongoing learning process for the entire community, and we will continue to hear each otherâ€™s feedback and improve these practices as much as possible.

**Any community member can suggest an idea on Discord and begin this process.** To bootstrap the initial governance process, only whitelisted members (staff and guild leaders) will be able to create proposals on Snapshot.

## Proposal Template

When submitting a proposal draft on the governance forum, please follow the following format:

**Summary** - A simple description of the proposal and its end goal.

**Motivation** - An overview of the motivation behind the proposal, including the context, the goal and outcome.

**Specification** - Proposal technical 

**Outcome** - YES and No on the proposal outcome / results
