## 🩳 Summary

<br />

A relatively quiet week on Radicle's Twitter page again. Quite a bit of discussion on the Snapshot poll taken at the start of the month which has resulted in some modifications leading to the current live (v2.0) Snapshot poll this week until the 29th of this month. Despite this, on going discussions continue increasing the awareness of Radicle, treasury's role in covering costs for Radicle Orgs and; new discussions regarding onboarding teams onto Radicle Orgs and removing the registration fee for their names.
