## Other Updates

This week the DAO discussed their Grants Program. More specifically, on how to structure it and learn from other programs such as Uniswap and Compound. Major themes that stood out were:
- Grants going to groups that shared similar values to Radicle such as collaboration over competitiveness
- A drip feed into grant funding to those selected based on milestones
- Having regular calls with grantees on their progress

Another notable discussion under the Development category is the notion of using NFTs as a badge
to prove ownership of projects citing their benefits such as:
- NFTs make better badges
- Allow flexible incentives for early supporters
- Existing tools already exist to enable "access" via NFTs
