# What is Radicle?

Radicle is a peer-to-peer software stack for building software together. Simply its a decentralized GitHub with a social & economic experience for developers that incorporates payments, decision making and more within code repositories.

There are no central servers, censorship-resistant, built on the open-source backbone of version control - Git and backed by assymetric cryptography. It helps developers manage access control with smart contracts, share code repo ownerships using multi-sigs and anchor a project's state on-chain. It also lets developers fund their projects and communities with NFT membership; help sponsor projects and participate in governance of those projects - all creating self-contained developer economies.

## Governance

Radicle's governance is transitioning towards decentralization via a DAO framework. For more information on the Radicle's Governance, its Treasury Framework please refer to Resources Section under the Governance Explainer and Weekly Updates for up-to-date information at the DAO.
