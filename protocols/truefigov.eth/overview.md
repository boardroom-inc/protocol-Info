# TrueFi
## Overview
TrustToken has launched TrueFi, the protocol for uncollateralized lending, powered by the first ever on-chain credit scores and governed by holders of the TRU token.

At launch on November 21st, 2020, TrueFi provided for (a) vetted borrowers to request loans denominated in TrueUSD (“TUSD”), (b) TRU Stakers to assess the creditworthiness of loans, © and TrueUSD lenders to earn attractive APY & TRU incentives on stablecoins loaned on the protocol.


Since that launch, TrueFi has evolved rapidly following a public roadmap, undergone two major protocol upgrades, started decentralizing protocol governance via Snapshot, and exceeded $200 million in loan originations with zero defaults — making TrueFi DeFi’s first and leading uncollateralized lending protocol.


While much of DeFi’s success has been built on overcollateralized lending, uncollateralized lending and bringing true credit scoring to crypto is widely seen as the next transformative step for DeFi. The traditional unsecured lending market makes up a $11 trillion global industry — yet none of that lending had come on-chain until TrueFi completed DeFi’s first uncollateralized loan in 2020.


Because uncollateralized lending provides an opportunity for lenders to earn higher long-term returns than secured lending, and for borrowers to maximize their capital efficiency, we believe on-chain, collateral-free lending will ultimately far outpace DeFi’s existing collateralized lending market.
