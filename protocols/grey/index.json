A way to derive value and income from your wildest imaginations. A way to feel liberated from the ideas of a central organization. A way to own your work from start to finish.  A way too deeply connect to your culture, your ideas, your community. From anywhere around the world. Together. Autonomously. Co-creating.\n\nTo proliferate the creator economy, in fashion. \n\nGREY is nothing, so you can be everything.",
