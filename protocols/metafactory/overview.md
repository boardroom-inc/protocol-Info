The current state of the “metaverse” is a series of fragmented, closed-platform worlds.

Our interoperable wearables standard bundles multiple 3D file formats into a single NFT, allowing for it to seamlessly travel between multiple virtual worlds.

Fashion runs on an outmoded operating system, which is why MetaFactory’s first upgrades are aimed at its physical/backend processes. Dedicated development in the areas below will open up entirely new dimensions for creative contributions, beyond the cyclically cosmetic.

Our decentralized design and production process begins digitally. Designers create product mockups using the adobe suite and Clo3D, which are then constructed in our Berlin and NYC microfactories with help from a worldwide web of suppliers.
