# Arbitrum

Arbitrum is a suite of Ethereum scaling solutions that enables high-throughput, low cost smart contracts while remaining trustlessly secure. Arbitrum has three modes: AnyTrust Channels, AnyTrust Sidechains, and Arbitrum Rollup

## Overview

Arbitrum is a type of technology known as an optimistic rollup. It allows Ethereum smart contracts to scale by passing messages between smart contracts on the Ethereum main chain and those on the Arbitrum second layer chain.

### How does Arbitrum work?
If you're looking to discover how Arbitrum works, the best place to begin is by the [Rollups basics](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Rollup_basics) section, which gives a high level overview of Arbitrum's internals. From there, you can jump into more detailed explainers on various components of the system.
