# OlympusDAO

Olympus is a "non pegged stablecoin" that attempts to be less volatile than traditional cryptocurrencies while not being pegged to any fiat currencies. Instead, the value of its OHM token is meant to float based on the value of its underlying treasury of assets and parameters set by the DAO. It achieves this through minting OHM when it is greater than its intrinsic value and burning OHM when it is less. The end goal of the project is to become a crypto-native currency that is used as an alternative to the USD or other fiat currencies.

### Governance

There are lengthy discussions around potential changes to the protocol and proposals on both the official forum and Discord server. Once an official proposal has been made on Scattershot, community members can use their OHM to vote. Concerns continue to be expressed on the forum and server by community members throughout this process and team members are very active in answering any questions. If a proposal is approved by the community (through the voting process), there is a DAO consisting of team members, investors, and advisors that implement the necessary contracts/transaction and execute the final decision made by the snapshot. The DAO was set up to prevent bugs and bad actors from buying up a majority portion of the supply and executing unwanted changes to the project in its early days.

#### On-Chain Governance Details

Governance is done via Scattershot, a fork of Snapshot made by Float Protocol which supports voting for more than one choice. Proposals are usually open for 2 days and during this time, holders of the OHM token can vote on which option they want, with more OHM representing more voting power. This process is completely gasless and requires no transaction (users only need to sign off on their vote using their wallet), which encourages more participation by all holders.

After a decision has been made, if an upgrade/change is required to the protocol, the Genesis DAO prepares the necessary contracts and transactions in order to execute the decision. They then have an internal vote, but this vote should always be in line with whatever was reached by the community in the Scattershot proposal. The team hopes that they will never have to overrule a decision made by the community and will only do so if the proposed change is clearly malicious.
