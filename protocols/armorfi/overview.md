### SMART COVER

Armor tracks exact amounts of user funds as they dynamically move across various protocols, and bills by the second using a streamed payment system. The result is minimized costs and maximized flexibility!

Currently supported currencies: ETH.

## The Armor DAO

This step marks a new and important phase in the transition to the Armor DAO as vArmor token holders can discuss about, start and vote on proposals:

A new discussion forum has already been started, where pre-proposals can be discussed and even put to an informal vote. One does not need any vArmor for this, just an Armor Forum account.

Once there is clear support for a proposal and multiple options to vote for, a detailed proposal can be made via on-chain voting platform.

vArmor users can then vote for any option connected to the proposal.
Once the quorum is reached, the proposal will be executed.
