# Premia.Finance
## Overview
Premia Finance is a decentralized financial instrument protocol that looks to change the landscape with new & innovative takes to traditional finance products. Currently supporting covered call and put options for various native Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain assets, each with their own marketplaces. Premia utilizes ERC1155 for the securitization of covered options contracts where the token collateral is locked up with the smart contract until either expiration, exercise, or early cancellation (if not sold). The Premia Options Minter was constructed to be able to write Options for any token denominated in either DAI/WETH/WBTC. Premia’s design allows for multiple contracts to be written, transferred, traded, exercised, as well as other features all in a single transaction, saving on gas costs and allowing for quality of life improvements for all platform users.

### How to use Premia?
The marketplace for Premia Finance can be used to write, buy, sell or exercise options from an easy-to-use, custom marketplace dashboard with menu tabs on the left side of the app.

### Key Premia innovations
Market driven options pricing - Each pool on Premia takes into account the relative supply and demand of capital within that pool to ensure a market-clearing options price is reached. This ensures optimal pool utilization at fair prices.

Liquidity sensitive returns to LPs - Returns on liquidity (options premiums) are priced according to the supply/demand of capital in each pool. Larger demand means higher option prices, which translates to greater returns for LPs.

Granular liquidity provision - LPs have control over which markets they underwrite, as opposed to underwriting the entire volatility market. LPs can implement customized strategies to granularly provision their liquidity only to the pools (and options) they desire.

Self-incentivizing initial liquidity - The automated pool pricing mechanism incentivizes liquidity providers to enter a pool from the time it’s launched, to get the highest returns. This ensures lower slippage by the time the first options are bought from the pool.

Dynamic Premia token rewards - Liquidity providers and PREMIA stakers accrue PREMIA tokens over time through our Liquidity Mining program and xPREMIA system, respectively. The amount rewarded depends on the size of their position and the length of the deposit (additionally, the amount of protocol fees generated determines the total size of rewards for PREMIA stakers).

## Governance
Community Proposals (“Preliminary Vote”) are proposals submitted by community members to amend how the protocol functions, what tokens are utilized for, how to deal with significant issues or enhancements, etc. Any member of the Premia who holds 100 Premia Tokens can submit a community vote. If the community vote is well understood, respected, and supported, then a Core Implementation Proposal may be submitted by a core member. The Premian Republic reserves the right to elevate a Preliminary Vote to a Core Vote.

Signal Proposals (“Signal Vote”) are proposals submitted by Core members to gather the interest levels of the community on a certain choice or implementation. They may be elevated from a Signal Vote to a Core vote, at the discretion of core contributors. Signal Votes that are supported or opposed are in no way binding to commit to further feature development, mechanism implementations, token allocations, etc

Implementation Proposals (“Core Vote”) either initially submitted by a core member of the ecosystem development, or elevated from a Signal Proposal or Community Proposal are propositions that are to be implemented in the Premia Ecosystem as necessary steps to institute have been completed.
