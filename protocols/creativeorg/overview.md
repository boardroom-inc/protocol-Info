# Creative Organization

A gamified blockchain platform for independent creators, fans, and brands to collaborate directly and earn rewards using P2E DeFi incentives.

## Overview

### Introduction

Content creation and distribution have dramatically changed since technology came into play. Making music no longer requires a team of producers and audio engineers to all be in a recording studio; anyone can record music in their bedroom nowadays by setting up inexpensive recording hardware and software. Additionally, distributing music no longer requires factories that produce physical records and retail relationships for getting those records into stores; music streaming platforms have enabled independent creators to distribute their music.
‌
Though redundant in the digital distribution age, intermediaries still control how the entertainment industry behaves and curates (Singleton).
‌
In 2019, the global music industry generated $21.5 billion, and only 10% of that went to independent creators (Watson). In comparison, NBA players develop 53% of the $7.4 billion entire profit (Jope), and the NFL players made 48% of the $16 billion NFL revenue (USA Today).

### Current pain points

There are several challenges faced by independent creatives:
‌
* Being successful or profitable takes hard work and reliable infrastructure. Usually, rookies don't have the time or money to dedicate towards starting.
* There is little to no transparency for how an independent creator is being paid out (i.e., gross, play count, geographic numbers, etc.).
* Licensing issues prevent Decentralized Storage Protocol (DSP) and content from being accessible worldwide.
* Significant time delays involving payouts to creatives.
* Publishing rights are difficult to comprehend and generally mismanaged.
* There are no direct revenue options for new independent creatives to generate income.
* Today's social media outlets are flooded with noise by creatives with large budgets.

### The Creative Platform

THE CREATIVE Project is the solution to all of the above pain points. The mission the Profit Sharing Community created around THE CREATIVE, is to bring imagination and originality to independent creators by offering services and innovative technology solutions to catapult their careers." As a whole, we will build a foundational belief that:
‌
* Creatives should directly engage with other creatives and transact with Brands.
* Token holders should earn lender status by creating value in THE CREATIVE Token and shared consistently between user groups contributing to the protocol.
* Prices and earnings for participants should be consistent, predictable, and transparent.
* THE CREATIVE Platform will democratize users' access to the protocol; anyone can contribute if they follow the protocol rules.
* Intermediaries should be detached whenever possible; if intermediaries are necessary, they should be algorithmic, transparent, and verifiably accurate.
‌
THE CREATIVE Protocol brings independent creatives, node operators, and Brands together in an incentivized way, allowing multiple roles to integrate and provide high-quality end-user projects to distribution channels and large Brands. These projects stand out within markets full of noise without centralized infrastructure. THE CREATIVE Protocol encompasses the following:
‌
* THE CREATIVE token, and stable coins: A platform token and shared token economy that aligns all participants' incentives with four primary prongs of functionality: access, security, staking, and governance.
* Content nodes: A network of nodes that is user-operated to host content and grant permission access to content on behalf of Brands.
* Content ledger: A source for all data accessible within The Creative's protocol, anchoring references to content hosted by content nodes.
* Discovery nodes: A network of nodes that is operated by users to index THE CREATIVE content ledger and provide an easy to query interface for retrieving content
* Lender nodes: A mechanism for granting advances to independent creators, which in return THE CREATIVE token holders (hodlers) gain interest.
* Governance: A system for modifications and improvements to THE CREATIVE Project; these shares control those who have created and create value on an ongoing basis.
‌
THE CREATIVES Platform creates a protocol where the platform's shared success focuses directly on the independent creators and the Brands responsible for its success. The protocol will also require end-user facing clients; this enables creatives to upload content, Brands to discover and stream content, and collaborate with other creatives within the network. The project team has produced a reference client implementation at g2entgroup.com.
