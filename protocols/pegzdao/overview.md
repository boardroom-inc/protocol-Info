# PegzDAO

PEGZ is a series of 100 unique collectables, each one of a kind and drawn digitally by Matt Furie. Every Peg character is a member of a family, one of 10 types, including "Pepe" who is present here in the rarest of forms.

Matt's vast world of characters come to life in the form of collectable/tradable files, each with a 2D avatar .PNG file, a 3D .GLB coin file, and an animated .GIF file.

The PEGZ project came about as Matt focused on digitally created work, and provides a unique opportunity for collectors to get into his vast universe of bizarre mutants and characters, the same universe that single-handledly spawned the most iconic internet creature of all time, Pepe the Frog.
