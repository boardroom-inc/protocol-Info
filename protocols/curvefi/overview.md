## Overview

Curve is DeFi's leading AMM, (Automated Market Maker). Hundreds of liquidity pools have been launched through Curve's factory and incentivized by Curve's DAO. Users rely on Curve's proprietary formulas to provide high liquidity, low slippage, low fee transactions among ERC-20 tokens.

Those resources aim to help new and existing users to become familiar with the [Curve protocol](https://resources.curve.fi/lp/understanding-curve-pools), the [Curve DAO](https://resources.curve.fi/governance/understanding-governance) and the [$CRV token](https://resources.curve.fi/crv-token/understanding-crv).

### What is Curve.fi ?

The easiest way to understand Curve is to see it as an exchange. Its main goal is to let users and other decentralised protocols exchange ERC-20 tokens (DAI to USDC for example) through it with low fees and low slippage. Unlike exchanges that match a buyer and a seller, Curve uses liquidity pools. To achieve successful exchange volume, Curve needs a high volume of liquidity (tokens) and therefore offers rewards to liquidity providers.

Curve is non-custodial, meaning the Curve developers do not have access to your tokens. Curve pools are also non-upgradable, so you can have confidence that the logic protecting your funds can never change.

### CRV Token

CRV token is a governance and utility token for Curve.

The main purposes of the Curve DAO token are to incentivise liquidity providers on the Curve Finance platform as well as getting as many users involved as possible in the governance of the protocol.

Currently CRV has three main uses: voting, staking and boosting. Those three things will require you to vote lock your CRV and acquire veCRV.

> veCRV stands for vote-escrowed CRV, it is simply CRV locked for a period of time. The longer you lock CRV for, the more veCRV you receive.

#### Staking (trading fees)

CRV can now be staked (locked) to receive trading fees from the Curve protocol. A community-lead proposal introduced a 50% admin fee on all trading fees. Those fees are collected and used to buy 3CRV, the LP token for the TriPool, which are then distributed to veCRV holders.

#### Boosting

One of the main incentive for CRV is the ability to boost your rewards on provided liquidity. Vote locking CRV allows you to acquire voting power to participate in the DAO and earn a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity you are providing on Curve.

#### Voting

Once CRV holders vote-lock their veCRV, they can start voting on various DAO proposals and pool parameters.

## Governance

### Understanding Governance

Voting on the Curve DAO
To vote on the Curve DAO, users need to lock vote lock their CRV. By doing so, participants can earn a boost on their provided liquidity and vote on all DAO proposals. Users who reach a voting power of 2500 veCRV can also create new proposals. There is no minimum voting power required to vote.

### Voting Power

veCRV stands for vote escrowed CRV, it's a locker where users can lock their CRV for different lengths of time to gain voting power. Users can lock their CRV for a minimum of week and a maximum of four years. As users with long voting escrow have more stake, they receive more voting power.

### The DAO Dashboard

You can visit the Curve DAO dashboard at this address: https://dao.curve.fi/dao
On this page, you can find all current and closed votes. All proposals should have a topic on the Curve governance forum at this address: https://gov.curve.fi/

### Submitting proposals

If you wish to create a new official proposal, you should draft a proposal and post it on the governance forum. You must also research that it's possible and gauge interest of the community via the Curve Discord, Telegram or Governance forum.
If you're not sure about the technical details of submitting your proposal to the Ethereum blockchain, you can ask a member of the team to help.
