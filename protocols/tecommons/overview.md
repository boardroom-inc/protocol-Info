# TECommons
Our vision is to enable the creation of ethical, safe, resilient and diverse economic systems to benefit societies around the world.

## Overview
The Token Engineering Commons began as a collaboration between two existing communities: the Commons Stack Association and the Token Engineering Academy.

The mission at CommonsStack is to build commons-based microeconomies that sustain public goods through incentive alignment, continuous funding, and community governance. Their library of open-source, interoperable web3 components allow communities to raise and allocate shared funds, make transparent decisions, and monitor the development and production of public goods.

With these tools and methodologies, members of the token engineering community decided to launch the Token Engineering Commons project in collaboration with the Commons Stack Association -- with the goal of advancing the field of Token Engineering as a science. The TEC began preliminary meetings in late 2019, and the development of a roadmap began to take shape.

The underlying goal of the TEC was to develop a well modeled crypto-economic system that could produce continuous funding for the production of new technical primitives, education initiatives, and token engineering research that would enable this nascent field of science to develop alongside the rapid growth of Web3.

There are two key components of the Commons Stack open-source library that is being used by the Token Engineering Commons: 
1.) an open-source ecosystem of token engineering tools & methodologies, which include the [Augmented Bonding Curve](https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751) (commons economic-engine), the [Conviction Voting Module](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475), and the Tao Voting module. 
2.) a cultural initialization system that provides a framework for the design of these tools and a system of governance that manages its production.  This is also known as the [Cultural Build.](https://token-engineering-commons.gitbook.io/tec-handbook/what-is-the-tec/the-cultural-build)

## Governance on snapshot

1. **Large impact cultural decisions**
When the Community Advice Process doesn’t provide a clear answer for how to move forward and a decision needs to be ratified by vote.
2. **Community signal**
Used to signal community support to proposals that aren’t ready to be on Tao Voting or Conviction Voting yet.
I.e:.
- The 75% governance giveback is a proposal that needed to be voted on the Hatch DAO, but the cost of 1000 wxDAI for the tollgate fee and the amount of work that would be needed to research and write the final solution to be implemented made the signaling vote the best option to move forward. With community support, the costs of time, research and funds needed for the final proposal could be spent more confidently.
- The Initial Buy In proposal also needed community signal. The final proposal will be submitted to the Hatch DAO, but a mutli-sig group needed to be decided before that. Holding a vote on Snapshot to decide the multi-sig holders before having a signal if the initial buy-in was even an option to consider wouldn’t be appropriate. So this signal proposal was voted on with yes/no options, and given the positive signal, the LASERTAG proposal could be submitted using Quadratic Ranked Choice Voting.
3. **Runoff votes (coming from crowd proposal making on Tokenlog**)
Tokenlog is a great tool to curate most relevant proposals, but it doesn’t work so well to pick one single winner. For that reason, the runoff processes from Tokenlog are hosted on Snapshot using Quadratic Ranked Choice Voting.
**Types of Snapshot Voting**
The TEC uses Quadratic Voting and Quadratic Ranked Choice Voting. Only TECH token holders can submit proposals. (soon to be TEC token holders)
**Parameters**
Support Required - the percentage of yes votes needed to pass a proposal.
- 88%
**Minimum Quorum**
- For every vote in Snapshot we need a quorum of at least 10% of the total token supply participating, including at least 10 unique voters.
**Vote Duration Period** - the duration of time each vote is open and eligible to be voted on.
- 4 days for Large Impact Cultural Decisions and Community Signal.
- 6 days for Runoff votes
