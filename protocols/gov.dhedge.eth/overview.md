# dHedge

Non-custodial, decentralized, social asset management on EVM chains.

## Overview

â€‹dHEDGE is a one-stop location for managing investment activities on-chain where you can put your capital to work in different strategies based on a transparent track record.

* Non-custodial: users retain ownership over their funds, investment managers cannot run away with investor funds.
* Decentralized: dHEDGE aims to create a permissionless, unstoppable protocol for asset management.
* Social: Managers have a direct line of communication with their investors, so investors know the reasoning behind their decisions.

## Governance

### dHedge Token (DHT)

The dHEDGE token, DHT, serves multiple functions:
* Facilitate decentralised governance.
* Incentivise investors to pool assets with top-performing managers.
* Incentivise managers to earn greater return.

### Rewards

Rewards for DHT stakers will be paid in DHT, dTOP, or sUSD. Overall DHT rewards are distributed as follow:

* DHT staking: 25k DHT per week
* Performance Mining: 35k DHT per week
* Protocol Treasury: Amount and token decided via vote per quarter

DHT distributed via staking and performance mining is done by increasing the circulating supply of DHT (inflation). Tokens distributed via the Protocol Treasury are done by liquidating a portion of the fees the protocol captures (protocol revenue).

### Staking

Staking dHEDGE Token (DHT) enables certain benefits, including receiving voting power to participate in dHEDGE governance and being eligible to receive capital rewarded on a weekly and quarterly basis.

To stake DHT, head to app.dhedge.org/rewards/staking.

To participate, enter an amount of DHT to stake as well as a lockup period. The lock-up period can range from 1 month to 3 years. The longer you lock up, the higher your governance and earnings power. Governance influence and earnings power are measured by vDHT.

DHT stakers will be able to make other governance decisions regarding the dHEDGE protocol by voting on the Snapshot page: gov.dhedge.org.

#### How vDHT Works

* vDHT is based on staked DHT * lock-up time.
* vDHT decays linearly over time.
* For example, a user locking-up DHT for 10 months instead. of 1 month will have 10 times as many vDHT.
* User can increase amount of DHT locked at any time as well as increase the lock-up time.

vDHT declines linearly as lockup time goes to zero. Your governance and earnings power is calculated as vDHT/(Total vDHT).

#### Staking Rewards

Staking rewards (earnings power) are based on vDHT. APY shown in the staking modal is the APY from your starting vDHT balance. As your vDHT balance declines, so will your staking rewards, and your true APY.

Longer lockup periods will have a higher initial APY, as vDHT will be higher, and staking rewards and APY will decline slower on longer lockup periods.

Additionally, APY is calculated assuming a full year, so it extrapolates to the full year. If your staking length is set to under a year, expect a return lower than the stated APY.
