## Overview of Krause House

The Krause House is a DAO governed by the community, the fans, the basketball lovers and purists. Together, they will write the consensus rules that will bring the first fan-governed team to the game as first participants, then fans, and now owners. The collective of ambitious contributors whose goal is to own an NBA team describes the underlying mission of DAOs in its purest form: Difficult by one, achievable by many.

Krause House will allow its members to participate in decisions affecting the operating procedures of a National Basketball Association (NBA) team including but not limited to ticketing, merchandising, partnerships, and general management of players and coaches.

As a DAO, Krause House champions evolving organizational mechanics and practices from that of traditional hierarchies, prioritizing ownership and autonomy. As the membership grows, so does the interdependence. Building confidence brought forth by the consistency of socialization and self-actualization. 

## Governance

There are three proposed models to Krause House involvement in team activities: a Majority Decentralized Ownership (DAO), Minority Decentralized Ownership (DAO), and Minority Decentralized Ownership (Social Tokens). 

1. **Majority Decentralized Ownership (DAO)**

In this model, fans would organize themselves as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) whose ownership rights, funding, and governance would all live “on chain” (on the blockchain) and purchase the majority rights (50%+) to a franchise.

Given a majority stake, they would strive to have DAO members vote on as many parts of the team’s strategy and execution as possible.

Krause House believes the fan community would provide the most value-add by having final say in the following areas:

 - Ownership decisions (e.g. buying or selling additional equity, allowing other investors and new valuation, etc)
 - Team Location
 - Approval of Key Executive Hires (GM/VP Ops/Head Coach/etc)
 - Marketing and Events (team uniform, player events, etc)

Krause House does not believe the DAO will provide value-add by participating in these areas:

 - Player personnel decisions
 - Contract decisions
 - Assistant coaching/training staff

2. **Minority Decentralized Ownership (DAO)**

This model would be organized identically to model #1 but the DAO would own a minority stake of the team. Given Krause House's goals on both ownership and influence, this model only makes sense if the DAO retains final say but in a more restrictive set of areas than model #1. These would include:
 - Team Location
 - Marketing and Events
 - At least partial say in key executive hiring decisions

3. **Minority Decentralized Ownership (Social Tokens)**

This model is where the team will create social tokens for fans to hold. These tokens will likely provide holders with benefits via digital goods (NFTs), special player and event access, and more. Krause House anticipates that big market teams will not extend ownership or revenue sharing (see Royal for what 3LAU is doing in music), whereas small market teams may innovate more here to collect a digital and worldwide fanbase. In this model, it is unlikely fans will have any governance on team operations and strategy.

### Recommendation

Krause House admits that the second model, minority-ownership will be the one that the NBA may accede to, more than the first option, since they would not allow a faceless organization to have majority ownership of a club, irrespective of the dollars on offer.
They believe model #3 will be the end-game for every sports franchise as web3 grows. Krause House’s responsibility is to not settle for this, and use technology and enthusiasm to think bigger.
