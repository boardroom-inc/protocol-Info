# Yearn Finance

## Overview
yEarn.finance is a decentralized asset management platform that has multiple uses ranging from liquidity provision, lending, to insurance. The most prominent product in its ecosystem is Vaults which maximize users’ yields by through various yield farming strategies proposed by the community.
## Governance
**Since YIP-61:** Governance 2.0 passed on April 25th, 2021, yearn began the transition into a multi-DAO structure, managed by constrained delegation. This approach allows protocol development to not be stiffened by bureaucracy while maintaining a sufficient level of decentralization.

Multi-DAO refers to the fluid number of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that contribute to the protocol in some unique way. These independent groups consist of YFI holders, yTeams and the Multisig.

* YFI holders vote for changes to the protocol or the protocols governance structure
* yTeams focus on specific aspects of the protocol or relevant operations
* Multisig members execute or veto any on-chain decisions

Token holders have ultimate say over what yTeams exist, who is part of the Multisig, and the limitations of each group’s operational control. The term ‘constrained delgation’ originates from token holders delegating specific powers to various groups that build and manage yearn.

A simplified flow of governance would look like this:

1. YFI holders create, destroy and define limitations of yTeams
1. yTeam notifies yTx of a decision
1. yTx creates a delegated transaction and send it to the Multisig
1. Multisig executes or vetos the transaction
