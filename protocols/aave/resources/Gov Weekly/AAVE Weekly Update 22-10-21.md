## Summary

Aave is having a strong start on Avalanche with the highest protocol TVL. Up for vote this week are risk parameter updates by Gauntlet, and a proposal to institute a voting delay period. Be sure to vote for this one, as it has a very large quorom requirement!

## Proposals

Last week, a proposal was passed to update 13 risk parameters across eleven AAVE V2 assets, mostly concerning Loan to Value adjustments.

This week, a similar proposal is up for vote to update nine risk parameters across eight AAVE V2 assets, including liquidation thresholds, loan to values, and liquidation bonuses.

Also up for vote is a proposal to institute a voting delay period for all on-chain proposals. This proposal by Gauntlet was inspired out of concerns that proposals need more time for a pre-vote analysis. Because this would be a change in governance mechanics, this proposal requires a large 15% quorum. This makes every vote more important than ever, so go out and vote if you want to see this proposal passed!
