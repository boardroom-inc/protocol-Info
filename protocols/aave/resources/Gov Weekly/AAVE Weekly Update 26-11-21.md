## Summary

AAVE has had another active week with three proposals passed, more than a few asset listing discussions, and program renewals under negotiations. 

## Proposals

* AAVE governance has voted for the Guardian to hold the emergency keys for V2. The Guardian is a multi-sig composed of reputable community members and will be allowed to pause the protocol in the case of an unforeseen event 
* Fireblocks will be a whitelister for AAVE ARC, the upcoming permissioned AAVE market designed as an offering for institutional investors
* The liquidity mining program has been renewed at a reduced rate

* A large showing for UST to be added to Aave, with risk DAO interaction
* BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK, and SUSHI are ready to be added to the Polygon market
* The AAVE grants DAO has opened discussion on the program's update and renewal
* Gauntlet is planning a second vote to renew their risk management relationship with Aave
* A nice analysis of the potential xsushi exploit has surfaced
