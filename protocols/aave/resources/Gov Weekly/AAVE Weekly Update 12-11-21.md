## Forum Summary

Gauntlet is requesting a renewal of their relationship with AAVE to help manage risk parameters. They are also updating the community on the risk profile of AAVE and providing risk parameter updates for the proposal listed above. AMPL is back in the forums again with discussions on solving the liquidity crunch due to the mechanics of the lending market colliding with the positive rebase resulting from the price pump of AMPL. Liquidity mining is up for renewal again, and the distribution parameters are up for discussion. Make sure to have your voice heard if you are a liquidity miner. Finally, there is a discussion thread up to discuss delegating to she256, a group dedicated to improving diversity in the blockchaiin space.
