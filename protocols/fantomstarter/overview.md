# FantomStarter
Meet the platform that enables everyone to participate first in the most promising projects and products with solid business plans to win top blockchain opportunities

## Overview
FantomStarter DAO empowers the token and NFT holders to decide about the next projects to be launched on the platform.
We are a team of professionals working in crypto for more than 5 years. Every sale decision of the protocol gets added to vote before being published on the dApp. FantomStarter Smart subcribers are the members of the DAO.

### Why FantomChain ?
Time and time again, we evaluate and advise start-ups. The biggest challenge projects
face is choosing a blockchain their community will gravitate to. The FantomStarter analysts
understand the mechanics a project requires and will guide Founders towards the best
solution.

Having said that, we believe most projects will greatly benefit from a Fantom build and are
excited to work with projects already building on the Fantom Opera Chain. While itâ€™s true
that transactions on Fantom are fast and cheap, the opportunity for interoperability is what
sets Fantom apart and why we opted to create the smart contract for the FS launchpad on
Fantom Opera.

In doing so, it has opened up investing opportunities on all the major chains, not just one.
The FantomStarter launchpad provides logistics on more than one chain. It supports
Fantom (FTM), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum (ETH), and Polygon (Matic) and many
others. This key differentiator allows Founders the freedom to focus on what they do best;
build their project.

## Governance
### Community Governance

The FS community Governance Hub is where projects
overlooked by the FS team but well-liked by the community can
be picked up through governance as Token & NFT holders use
their voting power to champion the projects they believe in.
Governance requires the voting power of the community, which
further expands the use-case of our $FS Tokens & NFTs. This
built-in redundancy sets in motion the execution of community
led projects and makes sure every opportunity for success is
given.

### Snapshot 
FantomStarter will empower the community by letting them vote on future IDO listings. Powered by Snapshot; a decentralized voting system that provides flexible governance across most blockchains, the FantomStarter community will now act as an additional crowd-sourced layer of assurance making sure the projects listed are not only internally audited by an experienced; dedicated team, but also reflective of variables outside of our control.
Whilst we utilize our expertise on the business, legal and compliance side, the FantomStarter community will use their collective expertise of market demand to determine if a project has what it takes to succeed beyond our initial recommendations.

Every Smart subscriber can vote based on how much tokens he used for the Smart subscription. Governance is fully on chain and to create a proposal you need to be Tier 5 or above. Both users subscribed with FS tokens but also FS Key NFT holders ca vote and propose projects. Every proposal has a 24hr cooldown and a 3 days duration.
