## What is Algorand?

Algorand is a decentralized network built to solve the blockchain trilemma of achieving speed, security, and decentralization simultaneously. Launched in June 2019 by computer scientist and MIT professor Silvio Micali, Algorand is a permissionless and open-source blockchain network upon which anyone can build. It uses a consensus algorithm called pure proof-of-stake.

It's native crytocurrency is called Algo.

## Governance Process

The Algorand Foundation believes in a fully decentralized Algorand ecosystem. Such a decentralized ecosystem, in which everyone can impact monetary, technical, and other policy decisions, best enables the Algorand community to shape the shared future of the Algorand network. 

The main tenet of this program is that any Algo holder can sign up to serve as a governor by committing Algos to the program for three months and participating in voting during this time. Governors are rewarded for their service to the Algorand community at the end of the three-month period. Importantly, the Algorand Foundation will yield to the governors the decision-making power over the Algorand Ecosystem Resource Pool (AERP), a pool of Algos that was identified in the initial announcement and currently has more than 3 Billion Algos. The program includes three processes:

**1. Governors recruitment and rewards.** This process will allow governors to sign up at the beginning of every three-month period by committing Algos to the program and collect their rewards at the end of the period. Governors are considered compliant (and hence eligible for rewards) if they maintained their committed Algo balance throughout the period and participated in all the votes during this time.

**2. Voting.** This process encompasses deciding on the topics to be voted on in each voting session, the governors voting on these proposals, and the finalization of the results of the votes.

**3. Execution of the decisions.** After the results are finalized, they are executed by the Foundation.
