# Angle

Angle is a scalable, efficient, over-collateralized and liquid decentralized stablecoin protocol. Angle could be used to issue virtually any type of stablecoins. The protocol is launching a Euro stablecoin, the agEUR, followed by other stablecoins in the near future, like or agCHF or agJPY.

## How does Angle work?

1. Angle enables people to swap their collateral against stablecoins at oracle value. Anyone can come with an accepted collateral (like wETH), and swap it to get a corresponding amount of stablecoins. It is also possible to swap Angle's stablecoins for an accepted collateral type of the system. For a EUR stablecoin collateralized by wBTC and wETH, with 1 wETH worth 1000€ you can get 1000 agEUR. If 1 wBTC is worth 10000€, with 1000 agEUR, you can get either 1 wETH or 0.1 wBTC.
2. To be able to always swap collateral against stablecoins and stablecoins against collateral, the protocol needs to remain over-collateralized regardless of the variations of the price of the collateral: it does so by issuing perpetual futures, which are leveraging contracts. People can come to Angle, bring some collateral and choose the amount of collateral from stable seekers they want to cover: they then get leveraged with the multiplier of their choice and at the same time they insure the protocol against the volatility of its collateral. If there is 1 wETH that was brought to get stablecoins by a stable seeker, someone can come to Angle, bring collateral (like 0.5 wETH) and choose to cover this 1 wETH (hence getting a 3x leverage). This means that this person gets the capital gains or has to pay for the loss she would have made if she had owned this 1 wETH from the beginning.
2. Angle can hence be seen a marketplace between stability and volatility: stable seekers get direct stability and people who want leverage and volatility get the volatility of the collateral brought by stable seekers. Yet, there may not always be a full demand for the offer in volatility taking the form of the perpetual futures. Angle needs a buffer of collateral to account for that. The protocol therefore enables people to come deposit collateral and serve as this buffer: these liquidity providers automatically accumulate interest on the collateral they deposited.
