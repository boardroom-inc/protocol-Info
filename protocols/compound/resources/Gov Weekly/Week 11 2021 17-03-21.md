| Legacy market migration: WBTC | Development | [View](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/41) |

Proposal 41 begins the process of migrating the legacy, immutable cToken contracts to newer, upgradable cToken contracts, starting with the WBTC market. No immediate action is required from current cWBTC holders, however, the COMP distribution will be redirected to the new WBTC market to incentivize users to migrate over at their own pace. Integrated applications should plan for a second WBTC market.
