| ZRX, BAT, and WBTC Parameter Update | Parameter Change | [Vote](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/39) |

Proposal 39 from Gauntlet would increase the collateral factors of BAT and ZRX from 60% to 65% and decrease the collateral factor of WBTC from 75% to 65%. If the proposal passes, borrowers with WBTC as collateral should check that the lower collateral factor does not put their position in danger of being liquidated.
