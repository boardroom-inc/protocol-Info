# Gearbox

## Overview
**Gearbox is a generalized leverage protocol:**

Gearbox Protocol brings you composable leverage, allowing anyone to margin trade on Uniswap, leverage farm on Curve, leverage stake on Lido, and use 10X more capital on many other DeFi protocols you already love. Making decentralized leverage a reality thanks to Credit Account abstraction!

Gearbox Protocol uses Credit Account abstraction to bring together lending and prime brokerage in the same protocol. Lenders deposit assets to earn passive yield, while the composable leverage side users borrow these assets to create spot leverage positions, which can be used across DeFi. That could be margin trading on Uniswap, farming on Curve and Balancer, leverage staking on Lido and Rocketpool, and a lot more. All of that is made possible with Gearboxâ€™s innovative Credit Account abstraction, creating the base layer of DeFi leverage.

## Governance

Gearbox Protocol did not have a core team from day 0, no central authority! Initial members handed over the code to the DAO who then deployed the protocol and even decided the initial pools, assets, collateral types, and so on. The DAO consists of the community multisigs and a few hundred of token holders as per the DAO-First Launch strategy. Snapshot + multisigs is used.


You can be in a DAO but not be 24/7 active, which is totally okay. There are different ways to get involved and get rewarded for your time and skills. 

**Workers / core contributors**: those who day and/or night work on different tasks as core contributors, ranging from marketing to coding. DAO contributors are split among different sub-projects and can decide to work on something specific, or a few tasks at a time. See Notion. 
**Delegates**: members who stay on top of protocol strategic ideas and plans, but donâ€™t have the 24/7 to really get hands-on operational tasks. They can become delegates and lead how governance decides on protocol vital things. 
**Shitposters**: you can meme, learn, and discuss DeFi in Discord. Weâ€™ll like you ;)

Protocols should be given away to communities as soon as possible, to let a movement start from the roots. But with such a decision comes big responsibility - ensuring proper and adequate governance rails for new members to coordinate, judge things, and decide on the future. And while fully on-chain governance models like Governor Alpha are seen as one of the staples that projects should aspire to - it's practically impossible to achieve that in the first weeks of a protocol life, because there are so many unknowns with regard to PMF, pools, and other factors. 

Given that, Gearbox Protocol governance DAO was set up in a flexible yet accountable way, innovating on some of the features to ensure a more streamlined environment

### Governance discussion process
**1. Ideation process, usually in Discord.**
This can occur in any chat really. Discord, forum, wherever. It's best to outline the voting parameters (WHAT are you actually voting for: YES or NO question, for instance) during this process so you would have a better understanding of what to propose on forum.

**2. Forum proposal and temperature check: first in Main, then in Proposals.**
After some initial feedback for an idea was received informally, a semi-formal proposal must be put on forum with concrete explanation of the proposed idea. A temperature check can be used on forum via a voting poll. Such things can easily be gamed, of course, so this temperature check should be met with a degree of scrutiny. 

**3. Actual formal proposal on snapshot.**
It should be put up for voting on the snapshot page, including the transaction details the DAO would be voting for, to avoid any multisig subjectivity later. This means that a proposer should seek technical help to prepare such a transaction prior to submitting a snapshot proposal. A quorum must be bet in such case.

**4. Multisig execution.**
Multisig must execute whatever proposal reaches winning quorum. Given that multisig are members previously enacted by token holders, meaning the DAO, are semi-public people with big reputation - in extreme cases they could voice against implementing some proposal. However, that could breach trust in the governance model and require immediate action and restructuring. 


### GEAR TOKEN

GEAR token is an ERC20 utility token, starting off as a governance token for the protocol - and then possibly taking any other new function the DAO could envision for it. The supply of GEAR is capped at 10,000,000,000 (10 billion) which can't be technically changed. See that in source code.
