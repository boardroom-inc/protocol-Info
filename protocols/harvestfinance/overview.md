# Harvest Finance

Harvest Finance is a Yield Aggregator that aggregates and automates the process of yield farming for our users.

## Overview

As Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has grown, it has become increasingly common practice for protocols to provide token rewards in return for utilizing their platform, generally in the form of 'staking' tokens. Collecting these rewards is generally referred to as 'yield farming' or 'liquidity mining.' Harvest Finance acts as in intermediary in this process, collecting tokens from many users and staking them en-masse on behalf of our users, saving them network fees (gas) and improving annual returns through auto compounding mechanisms.

On a regular basis, Harvest Finance automatically collects or 'harvests' the reward tokens on behalf of our users and exchanges them for more of the underlying assets that users deposited, thereby compounding the interest they earn. This saves our users both time and the network fees associated with making multiple transactions.

Harvest Finance was release to bring the spirit of 69 & 420 to the people. Reciprocity and Calmness can be obtained by pooling assets then sitting back and relaxing while Harvest does the hard work of compounding interest for you.

### Strategy Development

Harvest Finance team works hard every day to utilize the latest and most profitable techniques to bring returns to our users. New projects are relentlessly evaluated and pursued to increase our growing repertoire of yield farming strategies.

### FARM token

In order to provide incentives to yield farmers using the Harvest platform, the $FARM token was released when Harvest Finance launched on September 1st, 2020. The token was bootstrap launched without any premining, venture capitalist, or investor funds, with 0 circulating supply at launch.

### Profit Sharing

A key innovation of the $FARM token is that it entitles holders to a performance fee (currently 30% ETH and 8% BSC) taken from Harvest's yield farming strategies. While each strategy may farm different assets, the performance fee is used to buy $FARM on the open market, which is then distributed to those who stake $FARM in the Profit Sharing pool.

### iFARM

The interest bearing FARM token, iFARM, is a deposit receipt token for FARM that is auto compounding in the Profit Sharing pool. It can be obtained by selecting the "Use iFARM" box when depositing farm into the Profit Sharing pool.

### Council of 69

Launched in the 5th week of Harvest's operation, the Council of 69 is an investment syndicate that participates in early-stage project investments. It enables savvy users to leverage the investing power of the collective to bring further rewards to our platform

### ampliFARM

ampliFARM is a token that is rewarded in some BSC pools, it can be claimed immediately at 1:1 bFARM ratio or up to 4.18x. The ampliFARM maximum amplification factor is variable over time and It grows when people redeem their ampliFARM below the maximum factor as the Farm they do not claim gets put back into the pool, becoming claimable to other ampliFARM holders.
