# **Overview**

ZKsync is an infinitely extensible network of ZK Chains (rollups, validiums and volitions), secured by math. Over time, ZKsync is building towards seamlessly interoperability across chains, with a uniform, intuitive UX.

- **From the technical point of view**, ZKsync is an elastic chain, a federation of autonomous ZK Chains, interconnected natively at the protocol level, forming a zone of free movement for users, crypto assets, and data.
- **From the user perspective**, it will become a united, multi-chain ecosystem that feels and behaves like a single chain.

ZKsync has a dedicated governance system empowering its community, the ZK Nation, to drive continuous development and expansion of the ZKsync protocol. ZKsync governance enables token holder delegates to introduce proposals and vote on protocol improvements.
