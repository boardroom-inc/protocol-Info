**Perpetual Protocol is a decentralized perpetual contract protocol for every asset, made possible by a Virtual Automated Market Maker (vAMM). Our goal is to democratize powerful trading tools. Leveraged derivatives trading used to be the exclusive domain of centralized organizations and wealthy individuals. Perpetual Protocol lowers the barrier, making advanced trading tools available to all.**

Perpetual Protocol also has a utility token ([PERP - 0xbC396689893D065F41bc2C6EcbeE5e0085233447](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbC396689893D065F41bc2C6EcbeE5e0085233447)) with incentive structures to foster a vibrant, engaged community of users that will govern protocol development in a cooperative, democratic way. As such, holders of PERP tokens accrue voting rights proportional to their holdings.

To incentivize governance participation, we have designed the following incentive structure:

1. Staking rewards & trading fee rewards increase.
2. PERP token value increases
3. PERP token awareness increases
4. Protocol awareness increases
5. Trading volume increases
6. Trading fees increase

Use Cases:
----------

- **Governance**
Once PERP token holders have staked their tokens, they can then use their staked PERP tokens to vote on or propose new ideas that can be used to improve Perpetual Protocol. Ideas can be submitted as proposals to [gov.perp.fi](https://gov.perp.fi), such as adding new markets, updated to the protocol or anything else. Voting on proposals is done at [vote.perp.fi](https://vote.perp.fi/) using Snapshot, an off-chain gasless voting client. Before the on-chain governance voting platform is ready for PERP token holders, core protocol contributors will guide critical decisions. We believe it‚Äôs important to keep governance nimble in the early days of the Perpetual Protocol. You can learn more about the [governance plan](https://docs.perp.fi/getting-started/governance-plan) here.

- **Staking**
PERP holders can lock-up, or ‚Äústake,‚Äù their PERP for a fixed amount of time in the Staking Pool. In return, stakers receive rewards. Learn more üëâ[Staking](https://docs.perp.fi/getting-started/staking)

- **Exchange backstop**
In extreme cases, the exchange insurance fund may be depleted. In such an event, PERP tokens may be sold at market in order to make up for any shortfall.
