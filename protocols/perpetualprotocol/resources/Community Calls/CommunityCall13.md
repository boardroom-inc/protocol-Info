    - Less active ecosystem

- [synapseprotocol.com](synapseprotocol.com)
- Issue: low liquidity
- Many more!
 
## Testnet competition

**Wen Prizes sir??**

- 1 ticket = 19.69 PERP
- To claim 1 ticket, trade $2500 volume on v2
- Please watch for the announcement
  - Trading for ticket volume will start after v2 has run for a trial period.

## Q&A

- How is the Uniswap pool fee removed/handled in PERP V2?
- How difficult is it to build on Arbitrum and then quickly switch to Optimism? Do audits need to be redone? Does this delay the launch of V2?
- Since you mentioned that V1 won't be shutdown are there any updates on L2 deployment for v1?
- What happened to PERP Protocol on xDAI longterm?

Please refer to video for full answers of the Q&A sections :)
