# Current deals

We’ve been running this fund in stealth mode for some time and so far we’ve sealed the following three deals:

## Charm

Charm Finance is the prominent automatic liquidity manager for Uniswap v3.
Despite having a cap on each liquidity vault (also known as the “Alpha Vault”), nearly all of them have reached their cap and currently, the protocol’s TVL stands at $5M. Before launching liquidity vaults, Charm Finance has released several experimental (and later discontinued) products such as options and leveraged tokens.

This partnership with Charm Finance will make leveraged liquidity provision on Perpetual Protocol much easier. Makers can start earning transaction fees simply by depositing their USDC into any one of Charm’s liquidity vaults.

  "Charm is extremely proud to partner with Perpetual Protocol to build liquidity vaults for Perpetual Protocol LPs. The new vaults will combine Alpha Vault’s industry-leading expertise in LP strategies, and Perpetual Protocol’s leadership in building liquid markets for perpetual contracts. Charm cannot be more excited by this partnership, and we look forward to working with Perpetual Protocol to help LPs make the most of the opportunities offered by decentralized derivatives."

## dHEDGE

dHEDGE is the leading decentralized asset management protocol and allows fund managers to trade on Synthetix on behalf of fund participants.
At the time of writing this announcement, dHEDGE has over 400 fund managers and a total trading volume of $690M since the start of the protocol. In the upcoming dHEDGE v2, it’ll support multiple chains and protocols including Perpetual Protocol v2.
This collaboration with dHEDGE will help us tap into a new set of traders — professional fund managers. And as more CEXs tighten their rules for derivatives trading, we believe there will be an exodus of traders to DEXs and some of them will choose platforms like dHEDGE to earn additional fund management fees.

  "This future integration of Perpetual Protocol will let our pool managers become more capital efficient as they could access leverage both on the long and short side through the protocol. Additionally, managers would be able to execute strategies such as funding rate arbitrage which isn’t possible before the integration."

- Henrik Andersson, co-founder dHEDGE

## Lemma

Lemma Finance is the first and the only basis trading protocol allowing users to automatically capture profit using the price difference between spot and perpetual markets.
Lemma Finance is already on the Rinkeby testnet. When it’s released on Arbitrum, users will be able to deposit USDC to the protocol and share the arbitrage profits proportionally. By working with Lemma Finance, we can close the gap between the price on our protocol and the price on Uniswap hence creating a better trading environment.

  "Perpetual Protocol has and will continue to be an incredibly important partner for Lemma. The Curie v2 permissionless markets will allow us to build more capital efficient basis trading products and their move to a vAMM with concentrated liquidity will be a game-changer for our trade execution. We look forward to building more products on top of their derivative dex.""

Besides these three, we’re still in discussion with other potential partners and we can’t wait to share the news with you!
In the following weeks, we will unveil more initiatives that aim to support new early-stage and emerging DeFi projects such as grants, bounties, and volume programs.
If you’re developing a protocol and you think there are mutual benefits to working together, please reach out to us, and let’s have a chat.
