# Program Details

Perpetual Protocol is currently the largest decentralized perps exchange by daily trading volume, having captured 83% market share as of the beginning of June. To further secure this lead and become the go-to protocol for perp trading, weâ€™re excited to announce the launch of the Perpetual Ecosystem Fund!

The Perpetual Ecosystem Fund is backed by 3 million $PERP (worth over $30M USD) from the partnership allocation of the Perpetual DAO. We will do token swaps with projects that

- have a good track record, and
- a viable business model to integrate with or develop on top of the protocol.

We believe that by holding tokens mutually, we can speed up the integration process and also form a tighter relationship with our partners.

**If you think your protocol fits the criteria above, feel free to reach out to us on our socials.**
