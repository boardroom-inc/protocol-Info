**Rarible is the first community-owned NFT marketplace**

The ultimate goal of Rarible is to evolve into a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where all governance and decision rights belong to the platform users. Need a new feature? Have a vision how to make the platform better? Think someone is toxic and should be moderated? Or some members deserve an art or community grant? On Rarible, you have a voice, and your voice is heard.

We welcome the NFT community with active vision and attitude to participate in Rarible marketplace and build the fully decentralized marketplace of the future with us.
