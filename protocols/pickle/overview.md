# Pickle Finance

## Overview

Pickle Finance is a Yield Aggregator

Pickle aggregates and compounds yield from other protocols

It saves you time and money compared to doing it yourself.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has grown tremendously over the past year. There are many parts of DeFi, including lending platforms, liquidity protocols, stock synthetics, automated market makers, and more. Yield aggregators are another option in the Decentralized Finance space.

Yield Aggregators exist for yield farmers (like you) who want to invest money and maximize profits by leveraging different DeFi protocols and strategies for elevated returns. Pickle Finance makes it easy for you to earn great compounding yields on your deposits, when you don’t have the time to compound it daily or the gas fee is too high for frequent compounding to be done. In short, Pickle Finance is always on the lookout for opportunities to generate yield on your assets for all risk tolerance levels.

### How it works ?
Pickle Finance has Jars, and Farms

Jars compound your returns from other protocols for you.

Farms provide you extra rewards for staking your jar token

There are a constantly evolving series of opportunities for yield farming across the DeFi ecosystem. Pickle Finance provides a tailored selection of**Pickle Jars** and Pickle Farms that have been custom-built to earn yield from specific assets and through specific DeFi protocols.

#### Pickle Jars

Jars are the Pickle equivalent of yearn.finance’s vaults. A jar receives a specific asset (usually an LP token), such as sLP ALCX/ETH (Liquidity provider token for the ALCX/ETH pair on SushiSwap) and utilizes a strategy developed by the Pickle Finance team to earn yield on that asset. Your asset will auto-compound to earn more of itself, meaning your holdings of that asset will only increase. However, jars don’t prevent your asset from losing value relative to USD. Learn more about our set of Pickle Jars here.

#### Pickle Farms

Farms are the “next step” after putting an asset into a jar. When you deposit an asset into a jar, such as sLP ALCX/ETH, you will receive a number of pTokens (in this example, pSLP ALCX/ETH) that represent your share of the tokens in the Jar. These pTokens can then be staked in the appropriate farm to earn additional PICKLE rewards on top of your existing rewards. Your PICKLE rewards can be boosted by locking existing PICKLE tokens for DILL for up to four years.

### Why use Pickle Finance?

Pickle Finance may be tax-efficient when used long term

Pickle Finance is gas efficient

Boosts for farm rewards are available if you lock PICKLE for DILL

## Governance
The Pickle DAO

Pickle is governed by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Holders of “DILL”, a representation of a PICKLE token that has been time-locked on the platform for a set duration, receive voting rights to make changes to the protocol, emissions, and more. No single person is in charge. We’re all in this together.
