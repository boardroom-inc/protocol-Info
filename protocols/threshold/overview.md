# Overview

Threshold Network is a decentralize platform to keep your information and digital assets private while using a public blockchain. Initially formed as the first ever on-chain merger between two decentralized networks, NuCypher and Keep, Threshold now has a joint goal: guaranteeing user sovereignty on the public blockchain through the use of threshold cryptography. Now as Threshold, Keep’s infrastructure and NuCypher’s privacy tools will offer users an integrated way to keep their digital assets private and secure. The upgraded Threshold network will offer the best of what the Keep and NuCypher networks offer today. 

# Governance

## Structure

Threshold is governed by an eponymous DAO that includes the constituencies of both the NuCypher and Keep networks. The teams, along with the participation of the Threshold community, decided that a three-pronged approach based on Governor Bravo was the system that best-suited our goals for representation and governance. The Threshold DAO has three primary bodies: Tokenholder DAO, Staker DAO, and the Elected Council.

Each of these will hold the other two accountable, similar to the system of checks and balances found in most constitutional governments. They will also hold separate responsibilities that are embedded in the governance structure. See [this blog post](https://blog.threshold.network/thresholds-governance-structure-and-the-upcoming-council-elections/) and [this proposal](https://forum.threshold.network/t/threshold-network-dao-proposal-v2/57) for a more extended description of the DAO structure.

The Tokenholder DAO is on Ethereum Mainnet at [`0xd101f2B25bCBF992BdF55dB67c104FE7646F5447`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd101f2B25bCBF992BdF55dB67c104FE7646F5447). The Elected Council is implemented as a Gnosis Safe contract, with a 6-of-9 configuration, also deployed on Ethereum Mainnet, at [`0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f6e831c8f8939dc0c830c6e492e7cef4f9c2f5f). 
The Staker DAO is postponed until the complete functionality for staking is released. 

## Proposal Community Process

* **Step One — Temperature Check**: A Threshold community member posts a potential proposal on the Threshold governance forums. Community members who post the initial proposal are encouraged to get active in Meta governance discussions within the community on forums and in Discord to earn support for the proposal. There is no minimum token threshold required to create a new proposal on the forums. Temperature checks require offchain snapshots to pass. If a proposal receives majority support during the temperature check snapshot it is eligible to move onto the second step. Community mods reserve the right to moderate proposals during a temperature check by simply deleting the proposal from the forums.
* **Step Two — Proposal Creation**: A community member holding enough vote weight or stake weight submits the proposal on-chain. The proposal enters a two day vote delay period before voting officially begins.
* **Step Three — Vote Period**: Proposal voting remains open for 10 days. If the proposal passes according to requirements outlined above it moves onto step four. If the proposal fails it is canceled. Creators and supporters of the proposal may bring a modified proposal forward again but it must be sufficiently different and pass requirements outlined in step one.
* **Step Four — Execution**: Once a proposal passes, it will be executed. Proposals are executed by the particular GovernorBravo instance hosting them.
