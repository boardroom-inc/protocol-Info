# DAOSquare
## Overview

DAOSquare is a Web3 incubator that helps startups with token economy solutions, technology innovation, and community operations.

DAOSquare was born out of MetaCartel, a famous Western DAO community, and has been deeply inspired by the vision of MetaCartel and Moloch.

DAOSquare has now grown to become the most influential DAO in China and the greater Chinese area.

## DAOSquare Architecture

The DAOSquare Incubator supports innovators in three ways: Funds (VentureDAO), Products (mentor, incubation camp), Growth (market, community, listing, etc.).

The VentureDAO, a core part of DAOSquare incubator, is the coded realization of these visions.

It consists of three decoupling modules: a Fund Pool, Governance, and Vesting.

Specifics of the mechanism design will be revealed shortly that expands upon the picture above. These mechanisms seek to build a network that benefits all stakeholders.

DKP (DAO Kontribution Protocol) is a permissionless community contribution protocol. This system expresses our beliefs in the community (DAO) governance and growth.

Through DKP, the appropriately incentivized people can be gathered who will truly work to move DAOSquare forward.

These co-builders will eventually become owners of DAOSquare.

DKP will also be open to all projects and communities to help better achieve community construction and growth.
