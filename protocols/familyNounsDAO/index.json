Bringing families together with Family Nouns will benefit improved mental health, relationships, education, and reduced stress. Our goal is for families to have more fun, do more good, and spread more nounishness. And as a result, share the positive impacts with their friends, creating a positive self reinforcing loop.\n\nFamilyNounsDAO is building a community of Nounish families, and creating a family focused mobile and web app to drive engagement. This family DAO experience will make it super easy and fun to welcome families into Nouns to create Nounish things together. The overall vision for Family Nouns DAO is to proliferate Nouns and do good for families across the world at scale. \n\nFamilyNounsDAO: Families creating together, having fun together, learning together, and most importantly proliferating together. ⌐◨-◨\n\nTwitter: @FamilyNounsDAO",
