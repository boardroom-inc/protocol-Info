# Candle

Candle is the first spiritual, human-focused and inter-connected metaverse protocol.
Candle Protocol could be used to build any type of community. It is starting with the first spiritual portal on-chain.

## Overview

Candle is a growing ecosystem of connected projects and apps that together make up the emerging Candle Metaverse. Some refer to it as an ecosystem, or network, but they all mean roughly the same thing. 
The Candle Metaverse is designed to focus on humanity itself, enabling and supporting projects from religion to social media, and everything in between. 
As we develop and grow, we will continue to populate this page with relevant information and details of how we are progressing to our goal.
