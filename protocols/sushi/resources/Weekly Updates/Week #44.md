## Proposals Discussed

1. **Collateralize SUSHI Reactor**

[Tokemak](https://twitter.com/TokenReactor) is proposing for a DAO-to-DAO treasury swap of $3M to launch the reactor. The execution price is calculated via a 7 day moving average from the day the proposal passes; after which, Sushi DAO will become a major Liquidity Director on Tokemak. 

The Tokemak Reactor would strengthen $SUSHI liquidity by enabling $SUSHI holders to become liquidity providers. All holders will have to do is stake their $SUSHI, which will then be paired with another asset (eg. ETH) from other stakers - these funds will then be deployed as LP Tokens. In return, stakers earn $TOKE - **700 $TOKE/day** have been allocated as staking rewards to the Sushi Reactor. Users will also be able to stake their rewarded $TOKE into different reactors and vote where that liquidity gets deployed - it doesn't have to be a $SUSHI pair. 

The passing of this proposal would mean that more liquidity could be directed to SushiSwap and therefore adding market depth; enabling larger trades to take place. In turn, this will generate more trading fees and benefit $xSUSHI holders as well. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/yQGcJVw/Untitled.png" width="100%" />

The [proposal](https://forum.sushi.com/t/collateralize-sushi-reactor-on-tokemak/5919) will run for a week on the forum to gauge sentiment before moving to Snapshot which will also last a week. 

1. **Community Enabled Analytics Program**

Although this proposal received hugely positive sentiments from the community, it didn't reach the quorum of 5M Sushi votes - largely due to bad timing since everyone was focused on Trident and Sh≈çyu, thus this proposal is being looked at again. Omakase also feels that this could work well with the Kanpai proposal.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/MVg4S5R/Untitled-1.png" width="100%" />

**Proposal Recap:**

- CEA Main Features:
    - SQL query-able data updated in real time
    - API to build in external applications
- CEA Program:
    - Grants/bounties to create Sushi analytics dashboards that the core team and community thinks are essential
    - Attract and acquire new users and analysts via education programmes
- 1st Year Program Expectations:
    - Recruit and build up a community of around 460 analysts to produce on-demand insights for Sushi
    - 350+ unique dashboards, queries and visualisations e.g Trident Concentrated Liquidity calculator
    - 27K $SUSHI retained in ecosystem (Rewards that were kept and not sold)

A lot of progress has been made since the snapshot - [Flipside](https://twitter.com/flipsidecrypto) have had discussions with the Sushi Core Team and plans to help build and improve the current Sushi Analytics Dashboard with a multi-chain format. Also, a few sample Sushi analytics dashboards have been released and an ongoing scavenger hunt program has already onboarded 86 new Sushi users.

[Alex](https://twitter.com/Crypto_Alex17) from [Arca](https://twitter.com/Arca) acknowledged that the Sushi Analytics Dashboard has data all over the place right now, so a re-work by Flipside would be amazing. As an investor, Arca loves products that add value to Sushi as a whole so he supports the proposal. Analytics also help investors and the Core Team make better decisions, as well as allowing the community to market and back up their Sushi 'shilling' with statistics.

## Sushi OFFICIALLY LIVE on Moonriver

Since its inception, Sushi has always pushed the boundaries on innovation. Its growth has only accelerated in the last few months and it looks like we are just getting started. Sushi led the way in terms of multi-chain expansion and was one of the first DeFi projects to take this path; cementing itself as one of the big players in DeFi and propelling the growth of the entire crypto ecosystem. Sushi's suite of DeFi products is currently deployed on 13 different chains, with the latest addition being [Moonriver](https://twitter.com/MoonriverNW). 

<br />
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helloitsm3/protocol-resources/master/sushi/images/Week_44/ezgif.com-gif-maker%201.gif" />
</div>
<br />

Check out Sushi's [article](https://medium.com/sushiswap-org/moonbeam-x-sushi-everything-you-need-to-know-8a7a6a55cbb6) on how the partnership began and what we could expect to grow from this collaboration - spoiler: a very exciting future awaits. 

So what better way to start the week than to learn how to use Moonriver to start farming some $MOVR and $SUSHI. The Sushi Team has put together a [step-by-step guide](https://medium.com/sushiswap-org/moonriver-on-sushi-a-how-to-on-swapping-adding-and-bridging-b3d7a337a4b7) with all the information you need! Every aspect has been covered - from obtaining $MOVR to eventually adding liquidity on Sushi using Moonriver.

‚ùó**Important info regarding bridging:**

Users will need to use [Meter](https://passport.meter.io/transfer#/) to bridge over WBTC and BNB. [Anyswap](https://anyswap.exchange/#/bridge) should be used for all other tokens. For FRAX, you'll firstly need to bridge through Anyswap and then swap it out for the native version using their [cross-chain portal](https://app.frax.finance/crosschain).

## New Beginnings for Kanpeki

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bNrWYqz/Untitled-4.png" width="100%" />

'Kanpeki' is Japanese for 'Perfection'. 

Following a recent rebranding campaign, [Kanpeki](https://twitter.com/kanpeki_finance) is now ready to showcase its unique fixed-rate lending and incentivized borrowing product to the DeFi community. The majority of other platforms see fluctuating lending rates but through Kanpeki's innovative design, lenders are guaranteed higher fixed returns. Lenders can also stake $KAE to gain extra perks such as a reduced deposit lock time. On the other side, borrowers are heavily incentivized to borrow. Every time a borrower repays their loan - they will earn $KAE tokens and when staked, allows borrowers to lower their liquidation ratio by 3.5% and also have the option to extend their loans by 15 days!

This is only the beginning of Kanpeki's journey - they are planning to launch on Fantom first, followed by Polygon. Further down the line, they also hope to deeply integrate with Kashi - Sushi's first app built on BentoBox.

## Tempus x Sushi - Beginner-friendly Fixed-Rate Yields

Fixed rate protocols may sound intimidating and overly complex to many users. However, [Tempus](https://twitter.com/TempusFinance) has built a product that simplifies the concept of fixed-rate yields. The team have also taken innovation to the next level by allowing users to provide liquidity to earn even more yield on their yield-bearing token.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/YPgsQsB/Untitled-5.png" width="100%" />

### What does this mean?

Let's put it this way: 8.1M ETH is currently earning a variable staking yield. It's a guessing game as to what the interest rate will be today or tomorrow. But a solution has been built - via Lido, Tempus will be bringing in **FIXED-RATE** staking to Ethereum this month! You will also have the option to provide liquidity with your stETH to maximize your yields. 

Tempus will be initially launching with stETH and yDAI but the ultimate goal is to support any yield-bearing token on all leading DeFi protocols - ie. Compound, Aave and Yearn.

As if there weren't enough reasons for using Tempus, users can deposit the backing token so Tempus can turn it into a yield-bearing token for you. This further simplifies the process and offers even more flexibility for new users. 

TLDR; Tempus guarantees maximum returns on a fixed-rate yield with minimum effort on your behalf!

### What does Sushi Partnership Entail?

By collaborating with Sushi, Tempus will be in a prime position to become the most capital efficient fixed-rate protocol in all of DeFi. But the key advantage this partnership brings is access to the Sushi community. Tempus has already built up a community of 7000 early adopters with their [Sers Ambassador Program](https://twitter.com/TempusSers) and with Sushi's experience, they are hoping to take their community-building to the next level. 

Kashi, Sushi's home-grown lending protocol, gives Tempus the perfect opportunity to develop a fixed-rate lending solution on. In fact, they hope to be able to draw up a roadmap alongside Sushi to target institutional demand for fixed-rate yields on the Tempus platform - which would supercharge institutional adoption.

This partnership would also allow Tempus to receive advice and guidance from Sushi's world-class engineering and business development departments, so Tempus can become the number one fixed-rate protocol and follow in Sushi's footsteps to deploy on multiple chains.

## Say Hello to XDEFI Wallet - The New Must-Have DeFi Accessory

[XDEFI](https://twitter.com/xdefi_wallet) Wallet has been designed to bring you the most enjoyable DeFi experience.  We have all gotten used to the clunky UX of Metamask and the various bugs that come with it - isn't it about time we had a wallet that matched the innovation in the DeFi space? If we are to achieve mass adoption, it's clear that we need the perfect wallet that makes using DeFi a breeze. And it certainly looks like XDEFI is in the running to be the one wallet to rule them all.

XDEFI is a wallet extension built to handle all your transactions, assets and NFTs, regardless of which chain they're on. Hence the reason for the XDEFI Octopus logo! The chains supported so far are BTC, ETH, Polygon, BSC, THOR, LTC, BCH and LUNA, with plans to integrate AVAX. Users currently have to use an encyclopaedia of bridges to get from one network to another but the XDEFI team's main goal is to simplify the bridging process and allow all networks to interact seamlessly. It will also act as a fiat on-ramp, where users can purchase crypto using all major payment providers - including credit cards, Paypal and Apple Pay.

### Sounds too good to be true, what more can I expect?

Every inconvenience which we've had to get used to has been taken into consideration by the team. Future integrations include support for hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor, the ability to revoke unlimited contract allowances from within the wallet interface as well as a full-blown mobile and web app. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/2g8SBW0/Untitled-6.png" width="100%" />

XDEFI wallet will also be launching its own governance token which users will be able to stake to earn a portion of swap fees and also get rebates on all of their transactions. $XDEFI will be coming to MISO on November 10th - due to its popularity, whitelisted spots are filling fast!

So what are you waiting for? Download XDEFI Wallet [today](https://www.xdefi.io/)!

# Sushi Analytics

## Weekly SushiBar Recap

## Sushi Hits ATH in October with 146K Users

Sushi is just getting warmed up. Check out the charts for monthly active users for Uniswap vs. Sushi, brought to you by [BŒûN](https://twitter.com/__DeFi__).

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vB5js86/month-sushi.jpg" width="100%" />

## Calculating the Fair Value of $SUSHI

Is $SUSHI really undervalued ? Community members [@jackste73371898](https://twitter.com/jackste73371898) and [@RochelleSophie_](https://twitter.com/RochelleSophie_) spin up some metrics for you to decide. 

In case you're new, here's a recap. Sushiswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) -- which means it relies on self-executing smart contracts to facilitate trading. Rather than using order books to facilitate trades, DEXs use liquidity pools to determine pricing, and allow peer-to-peer instantaneous asset swaps.

The $SUSHI token gives holders the ability to participate in governance and also earn a portion of the fees paid to the protocol as a reward. Multiple liquidity incentives programmes are also held to distribute the token throughout the community as rewards.

The $SUSHI token currently sits at [the price of $12.29](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/) (at the time of writing), with a fully diluted market cap of $2,677,584,963 and a 24-hour trading volume of $178,863,340.

Now onto some stats:

1. **SushiSwap is available on the most amount of blockchain networks.**

Its liquidity pools span across 14 different blockchains, which is more than any other DEX and includes top networks such as Ethereum, Fantom, BSC, and Avalanche. Second in line is [Curve finance](https://curve.fi/) with half that amount.

1. **Sushi's DEX has been gaining [2,000 new users per day](https://sushi.leslug.com/) and is currently seeing nearly half a million users.**

<br />
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/woiVdPWGtvoXvmqRu4vcrkiLNvoOKPtASoPCU7cpTA7sm4X1Ohb8EGblbSvLRXlYfh9kivOvrTSjISxC7SEVQudZRWOWr-_q9rZl8Mh450TR_VwzUhxgu5C_h8XZ9QM1UF63FINK" />
</div>
<br />

1. **An average daily volume of [$300 Million](https://sushi.leslug.com/) has been recorded since late August. This means at least [$1 Million](https://sushi.leslug.com/) in fees are collected daily.**

<br />
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QyPaaUNsaNDE2ZwceAY2WfppqyC3i_CLyWA7CYpy8EEDyLTAcxeHsCGZq82WY1FxHhdmby83q_4mQzcdcm71qgQO3rq4UeWei2CxU_Ax-_R59crtnz1Ji8aBUiAx2rz6dvzU6wLl" />
</div>
<br />

1. **In just the past month, the total value locked [(TVL) on SushiSwap](https://andvis.com/Flipside/Sushi_pools) has gone from $4.2 billion to $5.5 billion.**

<br />
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ei8sj8vo_zET2QG5FmdVGZ9ufPe5mmoYiforTF2ubqDCfywsHBusUzhd8j5CMXNggALUPM7fi6Xbg4aibX1zGL6Inlg7H3H_UbJXOF1o_aYcWGGW6C2xZ0spBfSJ6ZLrGRCV-EYx" />
</div>
<br />

All these indicate a healthy protocol with a flourishing user base.

Sushi vs Competitors (at the time of writing):

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/VxwZB3h/Untitled-9.png" width="100%" />

Other metrics to consider as well:

1. **Daily swap volume / Fully diluted market cap**

From this, we can see that Sushi has a similar value to Balancer while having 60x the swap volume. Sushi is also valued at just 10% of Uniswap but has around 20% of its swap volume.

1. **Daily fees collected / Fully diluted market cap**

Holders of the SUSHI tokens are entitled to a percentage of the fees collected by SushiSwap - having a high ratio of fees to market cap means that SUSHI token holders are getting a higher percentage cashflow than holders of the other DEX tokens listed above.
