### Live Snapshot Proposal üì∏

`Community Enabled Analytics Program for Sushi [GRANT] - $1M Annually (In $SUSHI)`

- Free analytics solution combined with a bounty program to reward community members for learning, analyzing and publishing blockchain data

**CEA Main Features:**

- SQL query-able data updated in real time
- API to build in external applications

**CEA Program:**

- Grants/bounties to create Sushi analytics dashboards that the core team and community thinks are essential
- Attract and acquire new users and analysts via education programs

**1st Year Program Expectations:**

- Recruit and build up a community of around 460 analysts to produce on-demand insights for Sushi
- 350+ unique dashboards, queries and visualizations e.g Trident Concentrated Liquidity calculator
- 27K $SUSHI retained in ecosystem (Rewards that were kept and not sold)

**AMA takeaways with [Flipside](https://twitter.com/flipsidecrypto):**

- Goal is to get $SUSHI into the hands of analysts and users who are interested in the protocol

## $SUSHI Vesting has Officially Ended

A Sushi [thread](https://twitter.com/SushiSwap/status/1451721419004551170) on the journey we've been through üßµ

üç£ **October 8th** marks the end of $SUSHI vesting. All rewards are now unlocked and we thank you for your participation.

If you're new to our community, you may never have had the chance to "Claim" your vested rewards, but here's why this program made Sushi what it is today.

üç£ Sushi reward farming began on August 28, 2020 and was critical to the protocol growth, as it was a major incentive to draw from other liquidity mining programs. With sky high APYs, there was a DeFi flippening, as Sushi overtook Uni in TVL in less than a week!
Great, right?

üç£ With payouts as high as they were, Sushi farmers had one thing in common:
As soon as rewards were harvested, _they immediately sold_. This was good for the farmers, but bad for the farm and the $SUSHI price was suffering.
Something had to be done to reduce sell pressure.

üç£ The community rallied behind a proposal that actually prevented them from doing what they liked to do most: Immediately sell their harvested $SUSHI rewards!

Original snapshot found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/sushigov.eth/proposal/Qme8MYH2nWR3qcecxnVU5F824VJ2LjeKKr5mNaVdQ7ZfcF).

From September 29, 2020 all rewards were to be **vested for 6 months.**

üç£ The step that the community took to preserve the Sushi ecosystem and instill value to its governance token, resulted in a collaboration that generated over **$800 million** of sheer wealth and helped to establish Sushi as a DeFi blue-chip in a mere 6 months.

üç£ The proposal originally made by [@0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xMaki) and executed by Sushi core team member, [@LufyCZ](https://twitter.com/LufyCZ), really shows the power of community, the power of governance and the power of dedicated contributors and it is something that should be celebrated.

üç£ Thank you again for the year of $SUSHI vesting program and for all that it has brought to this collective. Goodbye vesting, hello unlocked rewards üéâ

## Sushi Buyback - Come on down to the Sushi Bar!

12 days since the last buyback, the [Samurais](https://twitter.com/asksamurais) have served up another 246,500 $SUSHI (currently ~$2.6M) directly to xSUSHI holders!

## Shoyu - A Closer Look

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/4J96WRr/Shoyu-infographic.png" width="100%" />

[Shoyu](https://twitter.com/SHOYU_NFT) is built to empower artists whilst bringing value to the Sushi Community - it is the NFT platform we have all been waiting for and is a place for both digital and traditional artists. With the launch approaching, let's dive into some of the highlights the platform will be bringing.

### FOR ARTISTS

### Split Revenue between Multiple Creators

Shoyu has been designed to allow artists to have complete freedom in collaborating with others. While other platforms limit you to 1 wallet for NFT proceeds, Shoyu allows an unlimited number of wallets to share the proceeds. You can even input specific details such as percentages and the role each person played in the creation of the artwork. The flexibility Shoyu brings for collaborators will simplify the entire creative process - and ultimately, encourage artists to build meaningful partnerships.

### Transparent Benefits for Artists and the Community

Shoyu is a platform that is purely community-driven and dedicates itself to putting artists at the forefront. Artists selling their work on Shoyu keep **97.5%** of the revenue, whilst the other **2.5%** goes directly to xSUSHI holders.

### Variety of Minting Options

Artists can choose from a selection of auction styles:

- `English` - the seller sets a starting price. Buyers increase their bids and the artwork is eventually sold to the highest bidder.
- `Dutch` - the artwork starts at an initial price but drops by a fixed amount periodically. The duration is set by the artist.
- `Fixed` - the price is fixed and the buyer receives the NFT immediately.

üí∞ Your auction can use any asset that is tradeable on Sushi (on Polygon and Ethereum) - giving artists further flexibility.

### FOR COLLECTORS

Shoyu has of course also been designed to make sure the experience is as seamless as possible for buyers and collectors.

### Powerful Searchability Tools üîé

Many other platforms tend to only feature the most popular recent NFT sales. But with Shoyu, a powerful newly designed search tool will allow users to easily discover new NFT projects - whether it is an artwork, wearable, powerup, collectible or new profile pic, Shoyu will cater to all of your NFT needs.

### Try Before You Buy

A hugely important feature which drastically improves the buying experience; Shoyu allows for high-resolution NFT uploads (up to 500MB), so you can see an artwork in its full form before making your purchase. Most other platforms limit uploads to 50MB or less, which means you don't see the original quality until after you have paid.

### Guided Tours

The Shoyu metaverse has been expertly crafted to give you the ultimate NFT experience. With Shoyu's guided tours, you will be able to see the gallery space in its full glory. If you prefer to discover the space on your own, a free roam option is also available.

The Shoyu experience will soon be available on your **desktop**, **notebook** or **smartphone**.

## Bridge Mutual - DeFi Protection üõ°Ô∏è

A topic that should be discussed more regularly in DeFi is **risk management**. For regular DeFi users, we know that the space is growing at an unparalleled rate. The speed of innovation is like none other and with that, we have seen a fair share of hacks and exploits. During DeFi summer, the main protocol providing smart contract coverage was [Nexus Mutual](https://twitter.com/NexusMutual) and so the Bridge Mutual team were inspired to build on that and develop their own product on Ethereum.

[Bridge Mutual](https://www.bridgemutual.io/) values decentralization the most and is owned and operated by the People. By using Game Theory, they have built a protocol that motivates the community to vote fairly on claims and ensures that malicious voters cannot influence the outcome.

**Two ways to participate:**

1. **Get Coverage** - get a quote and purchase coverage for your chosen contracts immediately. The cost will fluctuate depending on demand.
2. **Provide Coverage** - choose what you want to provide coverage for and provide liquidity to earn rewards in $BMI and stablecoins when users buy coverage.

üóìÔ∏è V2 will be launching on **October 27**.

Bridge Mutual will also be deploying to Solana, with plans to expand to additional chains. It will also be transitioning into a DAO.

üéôÔ∏è AMA Summary found [here](https://twitter.com/Trudahamzik/status/1451165609400496135) - includes V2 details and the claiming process.

## x.xyz - A Community-Owned Cross-Chain NFT Marketplace üé®

The team at [x.xyz](http://x.xyz) share Sushi's values of being completely community-focused. They plan to attract liquidity from [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) to become the next big NFT platform and maybe even force Opensea to launch their own token üëÄ

The developers at x.xyz want to bring their experience from running [Cream Finance](https://twitter.com/CreamdotFinance) into the NFT space. Having already launched on Ethereum and Fantom, they will be expanding to further low-cost L1s and L2s such as BSC. They have built a marketplace that allows artists to cheaply test out the NFT minting experience prior to minting on the Ethereum chain - which will undoubtedly open the gates for more artists to join the space.

The $X token will allow for protocol governance. It will be available to purchase on MISO in a Batch Auction that will require ETH.

### **$X Tokenomics:**

Total supply: 10 billion

**Divided as follows:**

Treasury: 80%

Batch Auction: 5%

Community development: 5%

Team: 10% with a 4 year linear vesting schedule

## $X airdrop for active users? ü™Ç

Minting, listing, buying and selling art on the [x.xyz](http://x.xyz) platform will also allow people to farm X tokens in the future.

It seems that users of [x.xyz](http://x.xyz) on Fantom may qualify for an airdrop based on their activity...
