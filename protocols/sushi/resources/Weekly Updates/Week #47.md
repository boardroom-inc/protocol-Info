# #4 - A Week In Sushi, November 22nd - 28th

Created: November 28, 2021

## Post Mortem üç£

After what has been a turbulent week for the Sushi Community, it is important that we reflect on the events that took place and how we can learn from the experience, in order to move forward together. As difficult as it may seem, there is no doubt that we will come out of this in a better place. This is not the first time Sushi has had to overcome a challenge and it most certainly won't be the last. But what we do know is that as a community, we are resilient and will continue to strive for what's best for the entire ecosystem. 

Weaknesses within the protocol's infrastructure are being addressed as we speak and measures are being taken to establish clearer processes across all departments, as well as between the Core Team and Community. 

Sushi has only grown to the place it's in because of the outpouring of passion and commitment from you - the Community. So let us stand together and be transparent in how we can make Sushi stronger than ever.

### A Breakdown of Events

[Joseph](https://twitter.com/josephdelong) and [Omakase](https://twitter.com/OmakaseBar) were present at this week's Sushi Forum call to discuss events and answer questions from the Community. 

After multiple internal discussions, the core team has decided to off board [AG](https://twitter.com/AGdyor) for a continued pattern of behaviour that made for a toxic workplace. Multiple exit interviews with Chinese community managers pointed to a toxic working environment. More recently, during the team‚Äôs internal disagreement, AG reached out to news organisations to attract more attention despite everyone‚Äôs consensus to keep it internal. The offer to AG was for severance with the conditions of non defamation and the handover of assets not secured by Sushi. However, the offer was ignored and resulted in AG tweeting about the situation. 

Many wondered why a community vote wasn't called on whether AG should be let go - but Joseph stated that although Sushi is indeed a DAO, it would not make sense to elevate every single decision to snapshot. The whole reason for having a Core Team is so decisions such as on/off boarding someone are dealt with by the Team. From an operations point of view, it makes sense that they should have autonomy on such decisions. Omakase also clarified, that only protocol changes and matters pertaining to the Treasury should be put up for snapshot vote.

### 0xMaki's Departure

To clear up questions regarding [0xMaki's](https://twitter.com/0xMaki) departure, Omakase stated that the team had a series of internal discussions on the best outcome and ultimately it was 0xMaki's decision to transition into an advisory role.  It was a very smooth offboarding process and anyone can approach 0xMaki to ask for his take on this. Joseph pointed out that it's not right to elevate someone to the level where they can't leave the project. 0xMaki's decision was supported by everyone involved.

### Future of Sushi Chinese Community

There was supposed to be an off boarding period that came with AG's severance. Unfortunately, it was rejected and the Chinese telegram group was one of the assets that Sushi couldn't reclaim. The Core Team plans to work with current and former volunteers to transition everyone into a new telegram group. The team is also happy to do an AMA with the Chinese Community.

### **Addressing Rumours**

![Sushi.png](https://i.ibb.co/0mVGpt1/Sushi.png)

> 0. No comment. Anyone can reach out to 0xMaki for more clarity.

1. There's nothing outstanding with BitDAO at the moment.

2. Not too sure on the allegations about Future.

3. True that I lost a significant amount of Sushi. I used [Cream](https://twitter.com/CreamdotFinance) to collateralize my Sushi to pay taxes. However, I did not demand a 100% refund. Only brought up the situation to Ops Multisig. No action has been taken, only discussions.

4. Yes, I do have 1.5M in my wallet.

5. Not true. Joseph tweets to let off steam.

6. Feels that it‚Äôs subjective. No comments.

## Kisha Club Proposal Coming to Snapshot! ‚úèÔ∏è

Our Kisha Club Proposal will soon be up for a snapshot vote üì∏ and we need you, the Sushi Community to help us out!

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helloitsm3/protocol-resources/master/sushi/images/Week_47/222222222.gif" />
</div>

As Sushi Journalists, our goal is to provide the community with the latest happenings in the Sushi space. 'Crypto never sleeps' is an understatement, this space moves at breakneck speed and it is near impossible to keep up with. This is the reason why the Kisha Club was envisioned in the first place - to provide the Sushi Community with information that is readily-available and easy to digest. Here is a quick breakdown on our proposal details:

- $5,000 USDC monthly grant for the Kisha Club - journalists are compensated for their time
- Information comes in the form of summary notes for every podcast/interview in addition to a detailed weekly newsletter

We are dedicated to creating top quality content for the community so if you would like to see us officially incorporated into the Sushi ecosystem, please vote for our [proposal](https://forum.sushi.com/t/kisha-club-sushi-journalists/5603) when it goes to snapshot!

From your Sushi Journalists,

## UPDATED CEA Proposal üìä

[Flipside's](https://twitter.com/flipsidecrypto) Community-Enabled Analytics Proposal garnered extensive support from both the Sushi Community and the Core Team. However, it was just short of meeting the quorum, with 94.5% of the vote in favour. Thus, the team decided to gather feedback from Sushi's core team as well as the Community to further refine the proposal and eventually resubmit it to snapshot üì∏

### **CEA Benefits** ‚úÖ

**Education Program - Training the next Cohort of Web3 Talent**

In addition to the encyclopaedia of data that CEA will provide, this will also pave the way for a number of other advantages for the Sushi Ecosystem and beyond. Through bounties and other incentives, the CEA program will be the perfect way to onboard new members into DeFi and attract contributors who may not have considered exploring Web3 before. An in-depth educational program will train new members to understand the inner workings of Sushi's complex system, whilst giving them the opportunity to learn how to build queries with SQL themselves. 

It's important to remember that this is an overwhelming space for newcomers. Many people outside of DeFi are reluctant to get involved, simply because they don't know where to begin. It is our responsibility to educate and guide new users in the right direction. This program would be the first-of-its-kind and most likely lead to other major protocols following suit. With an abundance of talent waiting to contribute to the world of DeFi, CEA's educational program is a much needed addition to the space.

**Token Retention - $SUSHI staying put**
By paying contributors in $SUSHI, the token is being delivered directly into the hands of committed Sushi Community members and as a result, it will play a big part in reducing sell pressure. Needless to say, this will benefit every single member of the Community. This is in contrast to the protocol's liquidity mining incentives, which is great for incentivising TVL and allowing users to earn $SUSHI but of course has a knock-on effect to the $SUSHI price.

Take a look at the stats across programs for other partners - on average, 77% of tokens paid out remained within the ecosystem.

### Preview of CEA Outputs

Now let's see what has been worked on since the original snapshot. Flipside recently hosted a Bounty and Scavenger hunt event to incentivize users to build some analytics pages of their own.

CEA guinea pigs, if you will! 

**[SushiSwap Analytics Dashboard](https://sushi.leslug.com/)** üßê

- Detailing user growth, liquidity, fees and more!

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/Z6FcgZW/sushiswap-analysis.jpg" width="100%" />
</div>


**[SushiSwap Fee Volatility Analysis](https://andvis.com/Flipside/Sushi_fees)** üìà

1. How have daily fees generated changed over the last 30 days?
2. How does the daily volatility in October compare to recent months?
3. Which pools have had the greatest fee volatility over recent months?

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/0J4Sj61/Sushiswap-fees.jpg" width="100%" />
</div>

**[SushiSwap TVL Projections](https://andvis.com/Flipside/Sushi_predict)** üîÆ

1. Predicting TVL based solely on its past values.
2. Predicting TVL based on a subjective estimate of future Ethereum prices
3. Predicting TVL based on forecasting future Ethereum prices

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/qJXKNL3/Sushi-Swap-TVL.jpg" width="100%" />
</div>

All in all, the CEA programme is clearly going to make everyone's lives MUCH easier üòå Community members will also be able to back up their argument on why Sushi is the best DeFi protocol - with expertly-curated stats to prove it!

## $SUSHI C.o.R.E. Reactor Online - Deposit Now!

The fire has been ignited and the flames are burning brightly. The community proposal passed with flying colours last week and the Sushi Token Reactor is now officially live for deposits. Users will be able to deposit their $SUSHI at [tokemak.xyz](https://www.tokemak.xyz/) in order to earn $TOKE.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helloitsm3/protocol-resources/master/sushi/images/Week_47/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" />
</div>

### What is $tSUSHI? ü§î

Please note that when you deposit $SUSHI into the Reactor, you will receive $tSUSHI, which can be thought of as your proof of deposit. You will need your $tSUSHI to withdraw your initial deposit. It's also important to note that whichever wallet your $tSUSHI is sitting in, will be the wallet that accrues $TOKE rewards.

Bear in mind that deposits are the first phase so your $SUSHI is not currently being utilized as liquidity. The next phase after deposits will be active liquidity deployment - make sure to follow [Tokemak](https://twitter.com/TokenReactor) to stay up-to-date.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/fkmy3sz/Untitled-1.png" width="100%" />
</div>

### $TOKEnomics

Tokemak's native token has the following use cases:

- Protocol Bootstrapping and Incentivization - $TOKE will be used to incentivize Liquidity Providers and Liquidity Directors - who have the role of staking their $TOKE to direct the deposited assets across various DEXs
- Voting Power for directing liquidity
- DAO Governance Token - shaping the future of Tokemak

To learn more about the $TOKEnomics, be sure to read Tokemak's very detailed [article](https://medium.com/tokemak/tokenomics-4b3857badc73) üìñ

Tokemak is changing DeFi liqudity as we know it - join the revolution today!

## SushiSwap LIVE on Telos!

Another week, another multi-chain deployment. The Telos EVM is the latest chain to be added to Sushi's list of available networks, with trading pools now open. Telos is an EVM-compatible chain that boasts the ability to prevent front-running, provide ultimate scalability and lightning speeds transactions.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helloitsm3/protocol-resources/master/sushi/images/Week_47/ezgif.com-gif-maker%201.gif" width="100%" />
</div>

### No Front-Running? How? üò≤

We all hate it when someone jumps in front of us in a queue! It's exactly the same in crypto. The problem of front-running started with bots jumping the line by offering higher gas fees in front of high value transactions. Which subsequently led to unfair profits being made. Today, it's miners who are doing the front-running. They place their own transactions at the front of the queue, whilst paying the minimum gas and force innocent users to pay extortionately high gas fees. This is known as MEV and has become a pressing problem in the DeFi space. It has reached a point where miners are being bribed to accept transactions directly - it is an extremely important issue needed to be addressed and protocols such as Manifold Finance have been working to solve this problem.

But wait, here is where Telos steps in. 

Telos brands itself as a 'third-generation blockchain' - its lightning speed is due to its unique infrastructure, where two new blocks are created every second. This leaves no time for those predatory bots and miners to front-run high value trades. Telos also operates with a fixed-rate gas fee on its transactions so users can no longer jump the queue by offering a higher fee. All block producers on Telos must follow the strict rules of processing transactions on a first-in, first-out basis. This is a standout feature of the Telos blockchain - it is the shield that has been built to protect its users from these malicious front-runners.

## Introducing Sh≈çyu Week Two Artists

The beauty of Sh≈çyu's v0 launch is that we get the rare chance of having an intimate moment with some of the world's most talented artists, all of whom are making us question what art is in their own unique way. When the whole space moves as quickly as it does, there's nothing more peaceful than having a whole week to meet these incredible artists and appreciate what they have to say. 

Week Two includes Oscar-winning visual artist, Cryptopainter, who has made it his goal to educate newcomers to the history of crypto through his paintings. Alex Schaefer with his iconic series of burning bank paintings - which resonates with the very heart of the DeFi community, representing the anger we feel towards the banking system. We also welcome other art pieces, from the quirkiness of Glamour Shot all the way to Sushi's Portrait Artist - Poison Hikari. These are just a handful of the artists Sh≈çyu will be showcasing this week. 

Be sure to check out the pieces on sale [here](https://www.shoyunft.com/home).

### Artist Spotlight - Raoul Marksüåü

Creator of the rare piece, ["OG_Astro"](https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/og-astro-%E2%80%93-inner-nature-28569) and a two-time Emmy award winning Artist, [Raoul Marks](https://twitter.com/raoulmarks) is well known for his work helping to craft some of the most iconic title sequences of his generation - including True Detective, Westworld and the Crown.

His works explore the surreal nature of the modern digital existence. Playing with repeating motifs of anonymity, isolation and cultural nostalgia, his art evokes a disrupted sense of the sublime and intends to leave viewers with more questions than answers.

Raoul's 3-piece collection featuring classic cars and an even more classic character as their driver is currently up for auction. But can you guess who the driver is? Place your bids over on [Sh≈çyu](https://www.shoyunft.com/home).
