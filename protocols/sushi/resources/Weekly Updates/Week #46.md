# A Week In Sushi, November 15th - 21st

## **Sh≈çyu Marketplace Open For Business**

November 17th 2021 was a monumental day. It was the day that saw the hard work of the Sh≈çyu team come to life. After months of building, the Sh≈çyu NFT Marketplace has been presented to the world. What started off as a proposal from [LevX](https://twitter.com/LevxApp) has now evolved into the most elegant digital art experience that puts new meaning in the concept of a community-driven platform. Minimalist in design, Sh≈çyu lets the art speak for itself.  

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helloitsm3/protocol-resources/master/sushi/images/Week_46/111111.gif" width="100%" />

In the first week of v0, Sh≈çyu will have auctions from ten handpicked artists, who come from a huge spectrum of multidisciplinary backgrounds. From reinterpretations of classical sculptures by GRIF all the way to dream-like glass sculptures by Hayne Park.

‚ùóPlease note that the majority of auctions are English Auctions - not reserved price auctions. Meaning time does **not** get added to the auction after users place a bid. 

### Thank You Gift üíê for v0 Collectors

Every v0 collector will receive a very special NFT as a gift of appreciation for supporting the Sh≈çyu launch. Earlier supporters may even receive a bonus gift. All of this would not have been possible without your support!

## **Sh≈çyu Week One Sale Highlights**

We are watching history in the making.

Sh≈çyu's very first sale went to female artist, [Luna Ikuta](https://twitter.com/lunaikuta), for her enchanting piece - "Bupleurum", which sold for 3 ETH.

Sh≈çyu's second sale was for an experimental quantum music art piece by [Keyon Christ](https://twitter.com/keyonchrist), which went for 7.1 ETH.

## OpenMEV Sushi Integration THIS WEEK üìÖ

[Manifold Finance](https://twitter.com/foldfinance) will be fully integrated into SushiSwap - this is a huge step for the future of DeFi as it protects users against on-chain predatory arbitragers, while drastically reducing gas fees - by up to 90%!

### Why Do We Need OpenMEV?

The Ethereum mempool, where transactions wait to be included in a block, is often known as the **'Dark Forest'.** It sounds haunting and quite rightly so because this is a place where predatory 'arbitrage bots' lie in wait for their next victim. They monitor pending transactions and wait for the perfect opportunity to exploit a transaction for their own benefit - ruthlessly targeting an innocent trader and causing them to pay extra gas fees. 

However, hope is not lost. Our saviour comes in the form of Manifold Finance's OpenMEV, which is the shield that protects users from these savage creatures in the Dark Forest. The integration with SushiSwap will shield users' transactions, which means they will be able to save on gas fees and reduce failed transactions. All of these steps happen within nano-seconds, so users will have the ultimate trading experience. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/mB9b739/Untitled.png" width="100%" />

### How Does OpenMEV Work?

This integration will provide an RPC layer for the Sushi frontend to interact with private mining pools. Users will submit transactions as normal but receive full privacy benefits. This means that transactions cannot be front-run and users may even get better price execution. The gas refund mechanism will start in a few weeks and potentially cover 70-90% of transaction costs. The refunding logic includes both arbitrage as well as positive slippage with the option to opt out if users prefer. 

Refunds are only for transactions on Mainnet and will be in the form of $xSUSHI. The process will be done manually at first, but will eventually be automated. Manifold will even be subsidizing gas rebates in the form of $FOLD for the first 4 weeks prior to MEV activation!

Just another reason for users to love swapping on Sushi!

## Own a Healthcare Company üè• - $GENE MISO Auction LIVE!

[GenomesDAO](https://twitter.com/genomesio) is currrently hosting its $GENE token sale on MISO - act fast if you'd like to participate as the auction ends on November 23rd, or until the max cap is reached.

30% of the $GENE supply is up for auction for 999 ETH. So far, 339 participants have raised 275 ETH (at the time of writing). If the protocol manages to raise the full amount of 999 ETH, 10% of the raised funds will be deposited into an Alchemix self-repaying loan vault. The profits will then be used to purchase more kits in order to onboard new users. 

What are you waiting for? This is your chance to drive the future of a project pushing the boundaries of medicine.

By making your genome data readily available to researchers and others in the medical field, you are directly helping the healthcare sector advance at a quicker pace in their discovery of new medicine. This has come at a time where we can actually see it being put into practice - through the search for a COVID vaccine. 

### Why should you care about your genomic data? üß¨

Your genomic data is your biological blueprint. It's what makes you who you are! It seems obvious but it's important to remind ourselves of how valuable this data is; it most certainly shouldn't be in the custody of a centralized healthcare company.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bXYGNy9/genome.jpg" width="100%" />

### A GenomesDAO NFT a Day Keeps the Doctor Away

GenomesDAO is launching their very own unique collection of 10,000 exclusive NFT bundles! They will each be priced at 0.1 ETH and will be ready by the end of this year. The bundle will include a Cat NFT, DNA kit and a random amount of $GENE and $GNOME! 

Make sure you're following [@genomesio](https://twitter.com/genomesio) to stay up-to-date. You can also join the Genomes [discord](https://discord.com/invite/genomes) to learn more about the project.

## Immutable X NFT Marketplace - Big Plans Ahead

He created the hugely successful Gods Unchained - one of the original P2E trading card games built on Ethereum. Robbie has spent the past few years working on the Immutable X platform, which is secured by the Ethereum network.

The protocol has already made waves in the NFT industry and plays a big part in onboarding household names to the NFT space - including the likes of Marvel and Disney. They even helped TikTok with their first NFT campaign. The team also has plans to help these corporations stay compliant within the crypto industry. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/0yqQkpY/Untitled-6.png" width="100%" />

Immutable X's vision is to create a global liquid NFT marketplace which incorporates all NFT platforms - including Sh≈çyu! They are even working on an [Opensea](https://twitter.com/opensea) bridge which is one of the team's top priority products to ship out this year. With such an ambitious roadmap, Immutable X is hoping to increase its team from 120 to 250 people within the next year. In fact, they are currently hiring so please head over to [jobs.lever.co/immutable](http://jobs.lever.co/immutable) to see how you could be a part of this movement! For projects that are interested in building on top of Immutable X, there are $2B worth of ecosystem grants available. To learn more, join the Immutable X [discord](https://discord.com/invite/Dmhp398dna).

Don't forget to also provide liquidity in the WETH/IMX [farm](https://app.sushi.com/farm). Doing so will allow you to earn double rewards in the form of $SUSHI + $IMX!

This drop will be Sh≈çyu's first audio-based NFT collection.

## Nicolas Sassoon's Process Notes on 'After'

"AFTER was modelled with an old version of Sketchup (v8). The animation was divided in six models with seamless transitions in between. The left side of each image shows the raw output from SU, the right side shows the final work."

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nzyWwQ2/after1.jpg" width="100%" />

"AFTER is made of 6125 images; each image is batch-edited using Photoshop scripts. The script resizes each image using nearest neighbor, then color indexation & dithering comes into play, then recoloring. This is true for 75% of the animation, with 25% requiring manual edits."

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8xBdtYq/after2.jpg" width="100%" />

"This process is very time-consuming and requires constant modifications: rendering each final image takes multiple steps & many sections of AFTER needed manual adjustments. In that regard, this process is comparable to analog animation rearranged into a digital workflow."

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/whKqWM3/after3.jpg" width="100%" />

"Finally, the soundtrack of AFTER was created before the animation! I had an idea of what I wanted to create, but it was important for me to have a soundtrack that would guide the overall structure of the work. I enjoy working with constraints, so it was also a fun challenge."
