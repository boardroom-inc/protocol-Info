- 94.45% voted in favour
- However, quorum not reached (needed 5M Sushi)

**2. Change $SUSHI denomination to a lower amount like $SHIB**

- Most don’t see the need for it as there is MEOWSHI in place already (available only on mainnet)
- 1 xSUSHI = 100k $MEOW
- MEOWSHI earns additional yield (on top of xSUSHI fees) through strategies and flash loans from BentoBox
- APR is currently similar to xSUSHI for now since there is no live strategy on BentoBox
- More use case to come in the future

**3. Begin Preparations for ZkSync v2.0 Deployment**

- Suggests starting testnet deployment for SushiSwap & Kashi on ZkSync now
- Ensure products are battle-tested ready
- Be one of the first to deploy when it launches

## AMA Takeaways

- xSUSHI staking may come to Polygon in the future
- Core team working on a Sushi bridge
- MEV protection is partially live. Team has launched production WebSocket and RPC API. Currently working with Sushi core team to monitor transactions. Rebates on gas cost to come later

# Buckle up for Sushi's Moonriver Launch

To incentivize liquidity on Kusama, Sushi will be starting its official liquidity mining program on [Moonriver](https://twitter.com/MoonriverNW) - a parachain on Kusama, which is Polkadot's sister network. This will be an important stepping stone in offering Sushi's suite of DeFi products to a whole new network of users. What's even more exciting is the entire new ecosystem that awaits - there will be an abundance of projects that are waiting to be built on top of Sushi in the coming months.

[Moonbeam](https://twitter.com/MoonbeamNetwork) is an Ethereum-compatible network, which will allow projects on Ethereum to be easily deployed on Polkadot. It will be live on Polkadot in December 2021.  Moonriver is the little sister of Moonbeam and lives on the Kusama network. They share many of the same characteristics, with the main difference being in the communities that have been built around them. Although Kusama initially started out as the testnet for Polkadot, it has now grown into a network in its own right, with its own unique ecosystem of projects.

Since it's pretty clear that the future is multi-chain, Polkadot and Kusama's ultimate goal is to allow seamless interoperability between all chains. 

### Moonriver Liquidity Mining Details:

The [Anyswap](https://twitter.com/AnyswapNetwork) bridge will be used to incentize USDT, USDC, WETH, FRAX and MIM. Whilst [Meter](https://twitter.com/Meter_IO) will be used for BNB and BTC. 

Sushi has received 25,000 MOVR tokens, which will be rewarded to liquidity providers and also used as an ecosystem grant to fund further development.

When the XCMP is live, this will also allow for Kusama-native tokens such as KSM and KAR to be supported as well.

![moonriver farms.png](https://github.com/helloitsm3/protocol-Info/raw/sushi-week-43/protocols/sushi/resources/Weekly%20Updates/Week%20%2343/images/moonriver_farms.png)

### What is XCMP?

A unique feature for Polkadot and Kusama; this stands for **Cross Chain Message Passing**, which allows for native interoperability between all parachains. This simply means that every parachain will be able to trustlessly communicate with each other, without the need for any external bridges. 

Check out Sushi's [article](https://medium.com/sushiswap-org/sushi-to-the-moon-the-future-of-defi-interoperability-2bda8a010479) for more details on the Moonriver liquidity mining program and an in-depth look into how Polkadot's interoperability model works.

# All Eyes on Shōyu v0 Launch This Week

The ****contracts are done, the curation has begun, and launch artists have been announced.

Please note that the initial launch is still **v0** - this is a 10-week period of exclusive NFT drops from a specially selected group of 10 artists per week.  

## **What exactly is Shōyu v0?**

Shōyu is a digital display interface and NFT marketplace that will allow anyone to mint, exhibit, and sell digital assets. State-of-the-art minting and auction technology will exist in V0, which allow whitelisted artists to display newly minted work, and sell them through a Fixed Price auction or an English auction. Artists and collectors will eventually be able to display their work within our walkable metaverse in late Q4, while our v0 metaverse will feature a curated gallery accessible to everyone to explore.

Shōyu’s initial launch, v0, can be thought of as a 10-week period of curated NFT drops that will be necessary to stress test the system, while the team develops and monitors the progress of the indexer, which is the most technically meticulous aspect of Shōyu’s development environment. Hence in v0, Shōyu will exist as a scaffolding infrastructure to build out the later iterations according to usage and governance. After this infrastructure has been monitored and assessed by the Sushi community, and the indexer is completed, future versions will be greenlighted and shipped with community-approved utilities.

The concept behind this rollout is that community usage should decide the future of the protocol. Utilities like social tokens, fractionalizing, and support for NFTs not minted on Shōyu will arrive in later versions.

![Shoyu infographic.png](https://github.com/helloitsm3/protocol-Info/raw/sushi-week-43/protocols/sushi/resources/Weekly%20Updates/Week%20%2343/images/Shoyu_infographic.png)

## Shōyu: A Closer Look

Shōyu has been built to empower artists whilst bringing value to the Sushi Community - it is the NFT platform we have all been waiting for and is a place for both digital and traditional artists. With the launch approaching, let's dive into some of the highlights the platform will be bringing.

### FOR ARTISTS

### Split Revenue between Multiple Creators

Shōyu has been designed to allow artists to have complete freedom in collaborating with others. While other platforms limit you to 1 wallet for NFT proceeds, Shōyu allows an unlimited number of wallets to share the proceeds. You can then input specific details such as percentages and the role each person played in the creation of the artwork. The flexibility Shōyu brings for collaborators will simplify the entire creative process - and ultimately, encourage artists to build meaningful partnerships.

### Transparent Benefits for Artists and the Community

Shōyu is a platform that is purely community-driven and dedicates itself to putting artists at the forefront. Artists selling their work on Shōyu keep **97.5%** of the revenue, whilst the other **2.5%** goes directly to xSUSHI holders. 

### Variety of Minting Options

Artists can choose from a selection of auction styles:

- `English` - the seller sets a starting price. Buyers increase their bids and the artwork is eventually sold to the highest bidder.
- `Dutch` - the artwork starts at an initial price but drops by a fixed amount periodically. The duration is set by the artist.
- `Fixed` - the price is fixed and the buyer receives the NFT immediately.

💰 Your auction can use any asset that is tradeable on Sushi (on Polygon and Ethereum) - giving artists further flexibility.

### FOR COLLECTORS

Shōyu has of course also been designed to make sure the experience is as seamless as possible for buyers and collectors. 

### Powerful Searchability Tools

Many other platforms tend to only feature the most popular recent NFT sales. But with Shōyu, a powerful newly designed search tool will allow users to easily discover new NFT projects - whether it is an artwork, wearable, powerup, collectible or new profile pic, Shōyu will cater to all of your NFT needs.

### Try Before You Buy

A hugely important feature which drastically improves the buying experience; Shōyu allows for high-resolution NFT uploads (up to 500MB), so you can see an artwork in its full form before making your purchase. Most other platforms limit uploads to 50MB or less, which means you don't see the original quality until after you have paid. 

### Guided Tours

The Shōyu metaverse has been expertly crafted to give you the ultimate NFT experience. With Shōyu's guided tours, you will be able to see the gallery space in its full glory. If you prefer to discover the space on your own, a free roam option is also available.

The Shōyu experience will soon be available on your **desktop**, **notebook** or **smartphone**.

The Shōyu experience is tailored for everyone, whether you are an early bird or a night owl. You'll have the option to see the Shōyu metaverse in either dark mode or light mode. 

Which one will you choose?

# Community Member Builds Comprehensive Sushi Analytics Dashboard

The Sushi Community strikes again. This time in the form of a [$SUSHI dune analytics dashboard](https://dune.xyz/hildobby/Sushi) with all the information you could possibly need to track your favourite token - built by [@dobbythereum](https://twitter.com/dobbythereum).

Check out Dobby's [full thread](https://twitter.com/dobbythereum/status/1453355259846344711?s=20) on how he went about this.

# Sushi Q4 - What's Cooking?

There's a lot to look forward to in Q4, with some of Sushi's biggest product launches to date. In addition to Shōyu, let's take a look at what we have coming up:

## **Trident**

The repos are [public](https://github.com/sushiswap/trident), and the rollout is imminent.

### **What is Trident?**

Trident is a study of the pool types that liquidity in DeFi naturally conforms to, and how we — the mythical “we” of the Sushi ecosystem — can make those pool types extensible within a future-proof framework. The benefit of its design is that new pool types can always be added, no matter how they build on the current framework, and no matter who is there to build them. We don’t know what the future of AMMs will be, but we’re certain it can and will live on Trident. In that sense, Trident is a study in the art of decentralized AMM development. It open-sources and decentralizes the process of building AMMs, such that the design can be iterated upon and improved *ad infinitum*, without the need for redeployments, new versions, or further centralized access. It’s the last AMM you will ever need.

Read Trident's Documentations [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11JoBg-OEkeGkFDVuujuXrCTgDy9xvNzJdIBPraP39eY/edit?usp=sharing).

  </a>
</div>

## **MISO**

Q4 will include a very important upgrade to the MISO UI, which will see it being integrated into the Sushi app. Since the beginning of Sushi, the team have strived to create a design that is fun and easy to use - a critical component for onboarding the masses to DeFi. Now the next step is to create a seamless link between all of Sushi's core products. It has always been difficult to balance the complexity of Sushi's innovative products with simplicity from a user's perspective, but thanks to the Sushi UX team and the community's feedback, the upgrade will make it even more of a dream to interact with all things Sushi. 

There will also be a major overhaul to MISO's vetting process. It will allow the community to take control of which new projects are given the opportunity to launch on MISO, in a completely decentralized and autonomous way. Stay tuned for more updates on this.

# Move over Chainlink, Meet DotOracle: Your New Favourite Oracle Provider

[DotOracle](https://twitter.com/DoTOracle) is a fully decentralized oracle and cross-chain liquidity network built specifically for Polkadot. Its oracle service will provide real-time data between Polkadot and the 'real-world', whilst its Bridge will allow users to easily move their assets between all EVM-compatible chains. In fact, the time it takes to bridge from Ethereum to Polkadot will be just 15 seconds! 

### What is an Oracle?

Oracles are the backbone of DeFi and have played a crucial part in the growth of DeFi. Without them, much of the financial revolution we are seeing would not be possible. Oracles are decentralized data feeds that connect smart contracts with reliable external data, since blockchains and smart contracts are not able to access this data on their own. This data can come in many shapes and forms, such as price fluctuations, weather reports or flight times. But in DeFi, we are mostly referring to crypto price feed oracles, which are one of the key building blocks. 

The leading oracle in the industry is currently [Chainlink](https://twitter.com/chainlink).

### How is DotOracle different?

The team have tackled a few issues which they believe are yet to be solved. 

The first is **usability** - they strive to create a product that can be easily implemented by any developer using EVM-compatible smart contract languages ie. Solidity. 

The second being **speed and cost** - currently, some oracles require validators to make transactions in order to relay the information to smart contracts. DotOracle aims to provide a service that is cheaper to run than its competitors, without compromising speed and security. 

DotOracle completed their IDO on MISO last week in 60 seconds. With 112 contributors and 36.27 ETH raised. 

The team hopes that DotOracle will become one of Sushi's prime oracle providers in the future.

# Ethernaal Leading Tattoo Revolution: $NAAL MISO IDO LIVE

![Untitled](https://github.com/helloitsm3/protocol-Info/raw/sushi-week-43/protocols/sushi/resources/Weekly%20Updates/Week%20%2343/images/Untitled%201.png)

The [Ethernaal Crowd Sale](https://miso.sushi.com/auctions/0xdcfD9b5d560898682F1aa523016987C6fC901CDF) is currently taking place on MISO. **20 million** $NAAL tokens are up for grabs at a fixed price of 1 $NAAL = 0.0002 ETH.

$NAAL IDO ends on November 1st 12:00 UTC. And soon afterwards, the Ethernaal marketplace will be unveiled.

### Evolving the Tattoo Industry

The tattoo art form has a deep history dating back to the beginnings of human civilization. Its rich tradition remained consistent throughout the years until the COVID crisis, which fueled the industry's need to find new ways of ensuring that this art form could continue to thrive. 

A key part of Ethernaal's vision is to simplify the entire onboarding process for artists who are new to the crypto industry. Ethernaal's partnerships with museums and art galleries will also play a fundamental role in this process. 

An **Ethernaal Virtual Tattoo Shop** is also in development. This leverages the metaverse by enabling people to 'try on' their tattoo in augmented reality.

Another highlight is the **Mastery Recognition Programme** which will utilize NFT technology to recognize artists as a Master of their tradition. This has been curated for people who carry the knowledge of specific traditions and techniques, allowing them to pass on the lineage of their art to future generations and therefore, contributing to a greater purpose.

Check out Ethernaal's beautifully presented [Ink Paper](https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.138.219/tme.219.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ethernaal_Ink_Paper_V1.pdf) to find out mor

# Top VC Firm Sequoia Bullish on Sushi

![54545445454.jpg](https://github.com/helloitsm3/protocol-Info/raw/sushi-week-43/protocols/sushi/resources/Weekly%20Updates/Week%20%2343/images/54545445454.jpg)

Sushi’s community and quick pace of innovation has caught the eye of [Sequoia](https://twitter.com/sequoia), a traditional VC capital firm which was founded 50 years ago. This has even led to them market buying and staking $SUSHI. To give some context, this is very much a firm that chooses its investments extremely carefully and 2 years ago, would not have even considered investing in crypto. However they are now undergoing a structural shift which allows them to be more open in their investment activity. They have doubled their annual invested projects, which has included 3-5 crypto investments a year since 2019. Everyone in the company is extremely excited about the future that crypto will bring; which certainly wasn’t the sentiment a few years ago.

### Why Sushi? What was it that made Sushi stand out?

Simply put, it was the community-driven aspect of the project’s rapid growth. Decentralization is of course the beating heart of crypto and what every project strives for, but no other project has seen the same level of commitment and passion from their community that Sushi has. We see this every day, where community members bring their ideas and collectively turn it into a valuable part of the ecosystem. It’s a regular occurrence for us and perhaps we sometimes take it for granted. But from an outsider perspective, this is a truly exceptional quality that is just not possible to the same degree in the traditional world. 

Together with the outstanding rate of innovation within Sushi and the passion of the community, Sushi is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with. And now the traditional world is starting to catch on.
