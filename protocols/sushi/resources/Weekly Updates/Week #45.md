## üö®LIVE SNAPSHOT ONGOINGüö® - Collateralize SUSHI Reactor on Tokemak

If you haven't been in the loop, here's a recap of the proposal:

[Tokemak](https://twitter.com/TokenReactor) is proposing for a DAO-to-DAO treasury swap of $3M to launch the reactor. The execution price is calculated via a 7 day moving average from the day the proposal passes; after which, Sushi DAO will become a major Liquidity Director on Tokemak. 

The Tokemak Reactor would strengthen $SUSHI liquidity by enabling $SUSHI holders to become liquidity providers. All holders will have to do is stake their $SUSHI, which will then be paired with another asset (eg. ETH) from other stakers - these funds will then be deployed as LP Tokens. In return, stakers earn $TOKE - **700 $TOKE/day** have been allocated as staking rewards to the Sushi Reactor. Users will also be able to stake their rewarded $TOKE into different reactors and vote where that liquidity gets deployed - it doesn't have to be a $SUSHI pair. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/yQGcJVw/Untitled.png" width="100%" />

The passing of this proposal would mean that more liquidity could be directed to SushiSwap and therefore adding market depth; enabling larger trades to take place. In turn, this will generate more trading fees and benefit $xSUSHI holders as well. 

Voting is **OPEN** until **November 15th**. Cast your votes **NOW** and claim a free "I voted!" POAP.

## **Babylon - The Prophets Are Coming**

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/rfmPGpX/Untitled-1.png" width="100%" />

A Protocol named after the book ‚ÄúThe Richest Man in Babylon‚Äù - [Babylon](https://twitter.com/BabylonFinance) is a community-led asset management protocol built on the Ethereum network which enables users to invest in DeFi together. It is non-custodial, transparent, permission-less, and governed by the community.

Anyone is allowed to create an investment community called a "Garden". Users can then participate in the Garden by depositing capital. Members of the Garden can suggest and vote on Investment Strategies. They will receive rewards based on their contributions.

Babylon has a two-layer governance system:

1. $BABL - Governance Token that holders use to vote on changes to the protocol and also determine how the treasury is managed 
2. Garden Tokens - Can only be obtained by depositing funds in a Garden. It is proof of the member's ownership in the specific garden

‚Äº‚Äº Special NFT Event happening from **November 15th -19th**. 

Prophets are a limited collection of 10,000 unique randomly generated NFTs that come with $BABL tokens. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/j9NWcb6/Untitled-2.png" width="100%" />

Currently only the first **9,000 Prophets** will be sold:

- 8,000 Common - Comes with 5 $BABL tokens each
- 1,000 Great - Comes with 6 to 1,000 $BABL tokens each & has special "boosting" powers

100% of the proceeds will go to the treasury. This will enable the protocol to bootstrap a liquidity pool on a DEX. Auction participation priority for Common Prophets will be given to SUSHI/xSUSHI holders. Successful purchasers of Prophets will be granted immediate access to Babylon's private beta with higher mining rewards. Get ready for an explosive auction!

## Trident Leading the Way - What to Expect

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/FVL3ps3/trident.jpg" width="100%" />

'Bad Trip' NFT

With Trident's imminent release, now is the perfect time to introduce Sushi to newcomers and also do a recap for community members who are eagerly awaiting for DeFi's 'next-generation AMM'.

**What is Trident?**
Trident is the next Sushi product, created to push the boundaries of DeFi, whilst providing the most intuitive experience for all types of users. Sushi originated as a place to swap tokens using the traditional AMM model but as many of us have experienced, sometimes even simple transactions have proven to be overly-complicated to new users and in many cases, caused them to make irreversible costly mistakes. This is simply unsustainable if our main goal is to achieve mass adoption. Sushi has taken on the challenge of re-inventing the wheel.

The core focus for Trident is to create the most capital efficient platform with crypto volatility protection. The most important aspect of capital efficiency lies in the ability to remove liquidity siloes between financial tools such as trading, lending and options protocols. 

The three prongs of Trident are:

1. Re-imagined cutting-edge AMM built natively on BentoBox
2. New pool types to give users ultimate flexibility 
3. A completely new routing engine to ensure capital efficiency

**BentoBox** completely changed the game when it was released. It was built to be the foundation of DeFi innovation. We can think of BentoBox as the state-of-the-art architectural infrastructure which allows developers to set up their shop on. These aren't just your ordinary shops, these are shops which push the boundaries to provide the most advanced financial tools allowing anyone to benefit from them; making it the electrifying hub of the financial revolution. Kashi was the first dApp built on BentoBox and soon it will be joined by Trident. 

![https://i.imgur.com/PEsx6oZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/PEsx6oZ.png)

Sushi's swap function currently uses the original AMM model where two underlying assets in a pool automatically re-calibrate due to price fluctuations, using the equation x*y=k. This model redefined everything and proved that DEXs are the future. However with the ecosystem evolving rapidly, we have also seen its limitations. Trident will see an expansion of **new pool types**; giving power to users allowing them to take control of how they want to manage their assets. 

The third main feature of Trident is its new routing engine called **Tines**. Tines will ultimately give users the best price solution for their trade, by querying all of Trident's pool types and taking into consideration many factors - including gas cost and price impact, ensuring that users are protected from DeFi risks. Users can get a good night's sleep knowing that Trident's routing engine will find them the best deal every time at just the click of a button.

## XDEFI The Next Generation Crypto Wallet - MISO Dutch Auction

[XDEFI](https://twitter.com/xdefi_wallet) Wallet has been designed to bring you the most enjoyable DeFi experience.  We have all gotten used to the clunky UX of Metamask and the various bugs that come with it - isn't it about time we had a wallet that matches the innovation of the DeFi space? If we are to achieve mass adoption, it's clear that we need the perfect wallet to help make participating in DeFi a breeze. XDEFI certainly looks like it is in the running to be the one wallet to rule them all.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/7vMLmx1/Untitled-3.png" width="100%" />

XDEFI is a wallet extension built to handle all your transactions, assets and NFTs, regardless of which chain they're on. Hence the reason for the XDEFI Octopus logo! The chains supported so far are BTC, ETH, Polygon, BSC, THOR, LTC, BCH and LUNA, with plans to integrate AVAX. Users currently have to use an encyclopaedia of bridges to get from one network to another but the XDEFI team's main goal is to simplify the bridging process and allow all networks to interact seamlessly. It will also act as a fiat on-ramp, where users can purchase crypto using all major payment providers - including credit cards, Paypal and Apple Pay.

### Sounds too good to be true, what more can I expect?

Every inconvenience which we've had to get used to has been taken into consideration by the team. Future integrations include support for hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor, the ability to revoke unlimited contract allowances from within the wallet interface as well as a full-blown mobile and web app. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/m8PgCyg/Untitled-4.png" width="100%" />

XDEFI will also be launching its own governance token which users will be able to stake to earn a portion of swap fees and also get rebates on all of their transactions. $XDEFI will be coming to MISO on November 15th.

So what are you waiting for? Download XDEFI Wallet [today](https://www.xdefi.io/)!

## The Future of DNA Data With Genomes DAO - MISO Crowd Sale

[Genomes.io](http://Genomes.io) - where DeFi and Science collide. The protocol has taken banking one step further by creating a private and secure DNA data bank that puts you back in control of your genome.

Self-custody of one's information and financial assets is what sparked this DeFi revolution. It's now time to take control of a valuable asset that stores your most important personal information. Your DNA. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8bkSq0S/Untitled-5.png" width="100%" />

**How does it work?**

Purchase a DNA sequencing kit from trusted sequencing providers which then securely stores your genomes in your own personal DNA vault. By granting permission to researchers to view your genomes data, users will earn $GENE. Your genomic data is your biological blueprint and it should be valued the same way everyone values their financial freedom. 

By addressing privacy, security and ownership concerns of DNA testing and sharing, the protocol is leading the way in building the world's largest user-owned genomic data bank to secure the future of personalised medicine. 

**$GENE**¬†is a deflationary utility token that pharmaceutical companies and research organizations offer users for querying their data. For every query accepted, the user will receive the equivalent value in GENE tokens. 

Here are 3 ways to earn passive income using Genomes.io:

- Get paid for providing your genomic data - Your data is stored in a vault. When pharmaceutical companies want to query your data, they will pay you in $GENE directly to your wallet if you accept the request
- Earn trading fees from pools when you provide liquidity for the ETH/GENE or ETH/GNOME pair
- Stake $GNOME - Governance token. This token will amplify the APRs of your liquidity pools and your earnings from queries. $GNOME allows users to become a member of the Genomes DAO and own part of the healthcare company!

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/hX3RcxL/11111111111.png" width="100%" />

Set your alarm everyone, 30% of the GENE supply is being offered to the public in a [MISO IDO](https://miso.sushi.com/)¬†for 999 ETH on Tuesday, November 16th. 

Sushi will be hosting an AMA on the same day - the perfect opportunity to learn more about this unique and very important project!

Check out Genome's [blog post](https://genomes.io/blog/post/gene-token-details-and-genomesdao-treasury-23) for a detailed breakdown on the $GENE tokenomics.

## Immutable Farm Live on SushiSwap Mainnet, Earn $SUSHI & $IMX Rewards!

[Immutable X](https://twitter.com/Immutable) is a layer 2 protocol for trading Ethereum NFTs. It provides users with instant trade confirmation, has huge scalability (9,000 transactions per second), and zero gas fees without compromising the user's ownership. The protocol's goal is to make minting and trading NFTs easier than trading traditional digital assets. 

Immutable X is also tackling the issue regarding environmental concerns by making every NFT that is created or traded on the platform, 100% carbon neutral. This is an important topic due to the fact that NFTs will be the gateway to crypto for many people. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Qv2Fz9B/Untitled-6.png" width="100%" />

With its recent successful token launch, $IMX fans can now put the token to work and earn even more rewards! Just by providing liquidity to the WETH/IMX pool, users can earn dual rewards in the form of $SUSHI and $IMX tokens. 

How to get started:

1. Add Liquidity to SushiSwap's Mainnet [WETH/IMX](https://app.sushi.com/pool) pool to receive SLP tokens
2. Head over to the [farm](https://app.sushi.com/farm) and stake the SLP tokens to earn an extra APR of over 100% 

A basic guide for Adding Liquidity can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/12-How-to-Add-Remove-Liquidity-3fe9a530bef947449c7442fcc9166a69).

## $ENS Hits $1 Billion Market Cap After Airdrop

The Ethereum Naming Service is a decentralized solution allowing users to register a unique domain name to replace long wallet addresses. This hugely simplifies the process of sending funds and minimizes the possibility of sending funds to the wrong address; an irreversible mistake which can happen to even the most experienced DeFi users. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/m0R8tCr/ENS-1.png" width="100%" />

ENS has been 5 years in the making and was founded by [Nick Johnson](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson). Those who owned an ENS domain on or before October 31st are now eligible to claim their $ENS airdrop; with the airdrop amount based on certain factors, including the address expiry date and whether users have set it as their Primary ENS.

There is a total supply of 100 Million $ENS tokens which will be distributed as follows:

- 25% airdrop to .ETH holders
- 25% to ENS contributors
- 50% to the DAO community treasury

Check out this [article](https://ens.mirror.xyz/-eaqMv7XPikvXhvjbjzzPNLS4wzcQ8vdOgi9eNXeUuY) for a more detailed $ENS overview. A "How to claim $ENS" guide can be found [here](https://ens.mirror.xyz/5cGl-Y37aTxtokdWk21qlULmE1aSM_NuX9fstbOPoWU). 

üìä Let's take a look at some data on the $ENS Token with the help of [@dobbythereum](https://twitter.com/dobbythereum)'s ENS airdrop tracker [dashboard](https://dune.xyz/hildobby/ENS-Airdrop)! Here are some interesting stats at the time of writing:

- 137,689 addresses were eligible for the airdrop
- 54% of addresses have already claimed the token, even though the deadline is on May 24th 2022
- The average gas price on the airdrop claim is 166 Gwei

You can also take a look at Dune's very insightful [thread](https://twitter.com/DuneAnalytics/status/1459098134408273940) on $ENS! It's an in-depth analysis which includes $ENS buy/sell pressure by [@MSilb7](https://twitter.com/MSilb7), a [Dumpooors dashboard](https://dune.xyz/mevcollector/dollarENS-Dumpoooors-with-sum) by [@mevcollector](https://twitter.com/mevcollector) and other information as well.

### Not sure what to do with your $ENS?

Sushi has you covered. A special [farm](https://app.sushi.com/farm) has been prepared for all new $ENS holders to earn some $SUSHI.

### Nicolas Sassoon [@Nicolas_Sassoon](https://twitter.com/Nicolas_Sassoon)

Using early computer imagery, Nicolas often engages in cross-disciplinary projects online - in Electronic music (New Forms), Fashion (Balenciaga) & Contemporary art. His work is no stranger to art institutions.

Nicolas' work has long been concerned with the tensions between the pixel and the screen, reflecting on their entanglement and materiality by integrating pixelated figures, moir√© patterns and early computer graphics into experiential displays.

"After" is a mesmerizing 4 minute video journey, a new direction for this renowned digital artist, through the lens of digital animation with [sound design by LNS](https://soundcloud.com/lauransparrow).

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/WBfdKGy/nicolas-1.jpg" width="100%" />

### Hayne Park [@gloryholelight](https://twitter.com/gloryholelight)

An emerging talent in glassware, the "Glory hole" refers to the light that radiates from the kiln used to melt the glass. Hayne is known for her otherworldly glass exhibitions and intricately handmade sake glasses. Hayne brings a fresh use case to the NFT space & we have a feeling that the Sushi community will go wild for her special [#Sak3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sak3?src=hashtag_click) glasses at launch

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/cx5YcNP/hayne1.jpg" width="100%" />

### Thom Mayne

Renowned American architect, whose visionary design can be admired on the streets on NYC, Singapore and San Francisco. His awards include the Pritzker Prize and the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal (2013).

Thom will be minting his first ever NFT collection on Sh≈çyu. It is a continuation of his investigation into highly organized combinatory systems, the work responds to chance fissures, unions and overlaps of networks, using randomness to generate unforeseen outputs. The collection explores the potential for NFTs to reinterpret sketching as a collective act.
