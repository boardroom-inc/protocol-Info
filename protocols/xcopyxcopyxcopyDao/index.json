    "description": "The XcopyXcopyXcopy DAO has three main objectives:\n\nTo move XcopyTumblr's works from a centralized service to a decentralized blockchain in order to preserve them indefinitely.\nTo fund scholarly Xcopy work, including curation, exhibitions, essays, encyclopedias, and display technology.\n\nTo acquire original Xcopy 1/1s or editions for donation to public museums as a public good.\n\nBetween February 2011 and June 2022, Xcopy uploaded images to his Tumblr every month except for April 2014. This body of work is a comprehensive and detailed documentation of the evolution of a truly original and highly influential style.\n\nAlthough some of these images were minted as 1/1s or editions on various blockchain marketplaces such as Superrare, many of the works were at risk of deplatforming or loss if Tumblr were to fold or be acquired.\n\nAs a result, the entire Xcopy Tumblr image archive was scraped, resulting in 1158 GIFs, 116 JPGs, and 302 PNG files produced by Xcopy over the course of more than a decade. The GIF files, which are considered to be the main artistic innovation, were divided into 18755 individual frames and saved as PNG files. The JPG and PNG files, which were mostly still images of comments, were excluded.\n\nDue to the implementation of nouns.builder, it was not possible to upload GIF files, but the process of converting them to individual frames resulted in some stunning images and provided insight into the Xcopy method. The style of the GIFs evolves throughout the archive, with some GIFs consisting of four frames and others consisting of over 20.\n\nThese images represent the first blockchain implementation of the historic Xcopy Tumblr archive. The 18755 frames were edited to 1773 of the best frames to fit within Builder DAO file upload limits, and at least two frames from each image were retained. The images are auctioned at a 69 minute interval.\n\nAll proceeds from the auctions are used to purchase original Xcopy editions or 1/1s or to fund Xcopy scholarly work. Decisions to buy works and fund scholarly work are made by the DAO through proposals.\n\nAll works acquired will eventually be donated to public museums for display as a common good, in accordance with the nouns principle. Only marketplaces that respect artist royalties will be used to purchase works.\n\nThis DAO is a tribute to both the originality and dedication of Xcopy and to the vision of 4156 and the original nounders. It is a blockchain-based public good.\n\nOriginal GIFs can be purchased on OpenSea or other marketplaces.",
