**[Bancor](https://bancor.network) is the first decentralized trading protocol, empowering traders, liquidity providers and developers to participate in an open financial marketplace with no barriers to entry.**

## DAO Process Overview

Anyone can create a new proposal for consideration by the BancorDAO; there is no requirement to hold BNT or vBNT. The guidelines for proposal creation are obligatory, and were written into DAO law with the passing of [BIP3](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip3-governance-changes-bip-documentation-requirements-and-new-majority-and-quorum-rules/97) on 24 October 2020. These guidelines have since been updated to reflect the DAO decision making process on Snapshot, and were accepted with the passing of the [BIP12 addendum](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip12-addendum-reorganization-of-dao-operations-on-snapshot/1467) on 26 March 2021.

The BancorDAO proposes, discusses and votes (with vBNT) on:
- Token Whitelistings, to grant token pools with single-sided staking and impermanent loss protection.
- Trading liquidity limits changes, to decide how much liquidity is used on a pool for trading.
- Pool fee changes.
- Bancor Improvement Proposals, and others.

The quorum and supermajority requirements for each category are:
- Whitelisting proposals: 35% quorum, 66.7% supermajority.
- Trading liquidity Limit <= 1M BNT: 35% quorum, 66.7% supermajority.
- Trading liquidity Limit > 1M BNT: 40% quorum, 66.7% supermajority.
- Liquidity mining: 35% quorum, 66.7% supermajority.
- Pool fees: 20% quorum, 66.7% supermajority.
- Governance and protocol changes: 35% quorum, 66.7% supermajority

The process to put a proposal up for voting can be found in the [DAO guidelines](https://gov.bancor.network/t/a-guide-to-bancordao-due-process/1669) and is the following:
1. Submit the proposal to the "Level 1 (Drafting)" on the [Governance Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network). Discussion lasts 2-3 days.
2. After discussion, the proposal is duplicated on the [Bancor Snapshot](https://vote.bancor.network) and voting lasts 4 days.
3. The proposal passes if the quorum and supermajority requirements are met at the end of the voting period.

vBNT is the Bancor governance token used for voting and can be purchased on Bancor or received after staking BNT. The Bancor Vortex uses a percentage of the protocol fees to buy vBNT and burn it.
