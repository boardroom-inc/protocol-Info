# KlimaDAO

Klima DAO is a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation for change. 
Klima DAO develops infrastructure incentives that fulfill our manifesto, through primitives such as the KLIMA token. 
As a matter of course, Klima DAO will solve the critical problems of the carbon markets: illiquidity, opacity and inefficiency.  
In delivery of its objectives, Klima DAO will become the single biggest disruptor of the carbon markets and set a precedent for a new monetary system backed by carbon.

### Objectives
By building a market-driven system that internalizes the cost of carbon, Klima DAO will deliver tangible results in the real-world by increasing the amount of carbon assets locked within the treasury, thereby reducing supply on the open market.

Klima DAO will leverage the existing carbon market infrastructure and improve on it; this will internalize the robustness of existing supply whilst disrupting demand conditions by bridging traditional offset markets with the liquidity of the crypto markets. 

Klima DAO will serve the web3 ecosystem by offering accountability for those that contribute, rewards for stakeholders, and a stake in governance for those that participate.

### How do I participate in Klima DAO?

Klima DAO development: Join the  Discord to become a Klimate and hear about Protocol developments. Those who wish to be involved in Protocol Governance should also join the Discord to be onboarded by a member of the team. 

Participation in the carbon economy: BCTs are the underlying asset within the KlimaDAO treasury and their flow into the treasury underpins protocol growth. BCTs can be created from real-world Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) via the Toucan Protocol. Bonders provide BCT LP or BCT tokens in exchange for discounted KLIMA tokens after a fixed vesting period. Once KLIMA tokens are held, stakers stake their KLIMA tokens in return for more KLIMA tokens.

### Who created Klima DAO?
Klima DAO was inspired by Olympus DAO. It was conceptualised and built by a distributed psuedo-anonymous team.

### Who runs Klima DAO?
No one. Klima is DAO-governed. All decisions are formed by community members on the forum and made by KLIMA holders through snapshot voting.
