    "description": "Lil Nouns DAO works to expand the Nouns DAO NFT ecosystem by creating a new layer of child Nouns NFTs, aiming to expose more people to the project. Similarly to its elder, the Lil Nouns Auction Contract will act as a self-sufficient generation and distribution mechanism, auctioning one Lil Noun every 15 minutes, for as long as the chain lives. 100% of auction proceeds (ETH) are automatically deposited in the Lil Nouns DAO treasury, where they are governed by the Lil Noun owners.",
