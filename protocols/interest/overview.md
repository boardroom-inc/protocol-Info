## What is 0x DAO?

0X is the liquidity endpoint for DeFi on multiple chains. The 0x API is a professional grade liquidity aggregator enabling the future of DeFi applications. 
As a decentralized exchange, 0x is looking to transition from a monolithic governance system to a dynamic variant collectively powered by users. The voting power is assigned to ZRX (governance token) holders, and in essence, anyone holding ZRX can participate in the governance of the 0x Protocol.

## Governance

The process is still in its infancy and is expected to mature based on the community's preferences and needs. 

1. **0x Improvement Proposals (ZEIPs)**

ZEIPs describe standards and protocol specifications for the 0x protocol (https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs).

Anyone can submit a proposal by calling the smart contracts propose on-chain function, but realistically proposers should rely on Bootstrap Delegates to perform this action. 

At the onset, there will be a minimum voting power requirement of 100k ZRX (0.01% of the total ZRX supply) for a proposal to be successfully moved to a public vote. Bootstrap Delegates are delegated enough voting power to submit proposals autonomously.

2. **Voting**

It is expected that the voting process will continuously improve with each subsequent vote, as well as become more decentralized over time.

* ZRX tokens and votes have a 1:1 ratio. 
* Casting a vote will cost approximately 80k gas. 

Once voting commences, voters will have 72 hours (1 full epoch) to self-vote or delegate 50% of their voting power to another ZRX holder. If the proposal manages to attract 10,000,000 ZRX yes-votes, it is queued in a timelock and eventually implemented by the core team.
