# Super Rare 
## Overview
SuperRare is a marketplace to collect and trade unique, single-edition digital artworks . Each artwork is authentically created by an artist in the network, and tokenized as a crypto-collectible digital item that you can own and trade.

You can think of SuperRare like Instagram meets Christies. A new way to interact with art, culture, and collecting on the internet!

In order to scale up and take advantage of the true power of web3, SuperRare is embarking on a path of progressive decentralization–shifting ownership and governance of the network to our community.

## Governance
$RARE token holders collectively govern the SuperRare DAO–a decentralized organization that will oversee key platform parameters, allocate funds from the Community Treasury, and effectuate proposals passed through community governance relating to improvements to the network and protocol.

### Governance Process:

A seven person governance council controls the SuperRare DAO Community Treasury via a 4-of-7 multi-sig wallet.

Council signers merely act as executors for decisions passed through governance. Signers do not have the ability to unilaterally allocate treasury funds and merely oversee the safety and security of the underlying assets controlled by the DAO.

### Governance Mechanics:

SuperRare Improvement Proposals (SIPs) are the means by which the community will present upgrades and distributions through $RARE governance. SIPs are created by token holders and shared on the SuperRare governance Forum.

Any member of the DAO is eligible to propose a SIP for consideration in the governance forum. Once a proposal has passed a temperature check and been formally sponsored by a Council member it will be eligible to be considered by the network in a Snapshot vote. To be accepted, a proposal must have at least 5,000,000 $RARE voting (or 0.5% of total supply) to achieve quorum, and pass with a 51% majority.
