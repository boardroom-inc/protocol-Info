| GIP-5: Remove Gnosis Impact from the GnosisDAO Governance Process | Meta | [Vote](https://deploy-preview-889--dgov-staging.netlify.app/gnosis/poll/QmfEpoQtvjWMeRwfeFvothLDkFqaXCZNHU9ZFb3S3cuLRU) |

Gnosis Impact is currently an integral component of the Gnosis governance process.
The current implementation of Gnosis Impact has known flaws and poses uncalled-for obstacles to pass proposals through the governance process.

This proposal aims to exclude the obligatory utilization of Gnosis Impact as part of the GnosisDAOâ€™s governance process phase 3 until a proposal passes amending its shortcomings.

- Creating stakeholders for both communities

| GIP-6 Deploy Gnosis Auction | Meta | [View](https://deploy-preview-889--dgov-staging.netlify.app/gnosis/forum/1078) |

This GIP intends to answer the question: Should GnosisDAO deploy GnosisAuction?

GnosisAuction would build on the proven success with token sales that Gnosis Protocol (GP) v1 (Mesa) had. It will provide a sturdy mechanism that supports fair price finding in token sales. It will also aim to be modular enough to work in other scenarios where auctions are needed.
