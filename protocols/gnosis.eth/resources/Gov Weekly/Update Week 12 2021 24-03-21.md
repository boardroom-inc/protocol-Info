| GIP-9: Launch Liquidity Mining program for Prediction Markets using Gnosis Conditional Tokens | Product/Meta | [Discuss](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-9-launch-liquidity-mining-program-for-prediction-markets-using-gnosis-conditional-tokens/1132) |

Summary:\
GnosisDAO will launch a Liquidity Mining program for prediction markets using Gnosis Conditional Tokens that would reward liquidity providers with GNO to incentivize a curated set of markets and thus boost the use of Gnosis Conditional Tokens.

This proposal is a continuation of an [original post](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/should-gnosisdao-launch-a-liquidity-mining-program-for-prediction-markets-using-gnosis-conditional-tokens/1109/5)
on the issue, moving the discussion from Phase-1 to Phase-2.

| GIP-8: Enable LP token voting on Snapshot | Meta | [Discuss](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-8-enable-lp-token-voting-on-snapshot/1116) |

Summary:\
This post suggests adding a LP token voting strategy to the Gnosis Snapshot space.

It is a continuation of an [original post](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/should-gnosisdao-allow-to-use-gno-locked-in-balancer-pools-for-voting-in-snapshot-proposals/902)
on the issue, moving the discussion from Phase-1 to Phase-2.

Update:\
Before moving on to Phase 3 (voting on Snapshot), there are [questions](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-8-enable-lp-token-voting-on-snapshot/1116/8) regarding which options to include in the vote.
There are concerns that the voting threshold will not be met as the forum vote only recieved 19 participants.
