## Overview

KyberDAO stands for Kyber Decentralized Autonomous Organization. KyberDAO is a community platform that empowers KNC (Kyber Network Crystal) token holders to participate in the governance of Kyber Network. KNC holders can stake their tokens to vote on important proposals. In return, they receive rewards from part of the network fees collected through trading activities on Kyber Network. Voting is done in a fully on-chain and transparent manner.

KNC is the first deflationary staking token, through which staking rewards and token burns are determined by actual network and DeFi growth.

## Governance

### Why should I participate in KyberDAO

KyberDAO allows KNC token holders to play a critical role in determining the incentive system, building a wide base of stakeholders, and facilitating economic flow in the network. Together, KNC holders can chart the future success of Kyber Network.

This KyberDAO is meant for 3 key groups of Kyber Network stakeholders — 1. Reserve managers who provide liquidity to Kyber 2. Takers/DApps/traders who connect to Kyber to use its liquidity 3. KNC holders who are at the heart of Kyber

Participating in the KyberDAO allows you, a Kyber community member, to help contribute towards the success of the project. In return, you are able to earn KNC rewards for your efforts, with rewards coming from a portion of network fees collected through trading activities on Kyber.

### How should I participate ?

All you need is an Ethereum wallet and KNC tokens to participate. Simply follow these steps:
1. Open kyber.org
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet
3. Stake KNC to get voting power (or delegate your voting power to someone else e.g. a staking service)
4. Wait for the next voting epoch to start
5. Vote on all proposals
6. After voting, claim your rewards in next epoch
