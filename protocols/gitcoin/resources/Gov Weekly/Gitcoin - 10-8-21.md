## Summary

In Gitcoin DAO news, Kevin Owocki authored a thread titled 'How might we Decentralize Gitcoin?.' The post lays out “a high level view of how we might decentralize Gitcoin from a platform into a series of protocols. This post contains much of the same information as Scott Moore's (Gitcoin) EDCon talk "Decentralizing Gitcoin Grants 3.” You can check out his talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucaA3sh3SRA">here</a>.

A thread on Stewards Voting Power was created by Kevin Owocki to to track how voting power of the stewards evolve over time. The code used can be found <a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/pull/9380/">here</a>.

Memepalooza2 was hosted by the workstream last Friday in the Discord. Over 50 people joined and created over 100 memes on the topic for public goods, the open internet and the values of GitcoinDAO. They also had a live DJ playing tunes and they tested out coordination tools from Moonshot collective; tip.party 1 and Quadratic Diplomacy.

Fred recently gave a presentation and shared details on the Steward Report Cards project during a demo event hosted by Moonshot Collective. A video recording of the presentation will be uploaded to Moonshot Collectives Youtube page.
