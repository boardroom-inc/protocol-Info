## Summary

In Gitcoin DAO news, Kevin Owocki authored a thread that explores how GitcoinDAO "can create more impact toward its mission of more coordination and reduction of coordination failures." As noted by the GitcoinDAO digest, Kevin brings into focus "how the product suite, built by GitcoinDAO will be deployed to help partner DAOs better source, select, sell, onboard and retain talent" and "become a perpetual motion machine that reinforces itself" benefitting the entire ecosystem.

The mission post can be viewed <a href="https://gitcoin.co/mission/">here</a>.
