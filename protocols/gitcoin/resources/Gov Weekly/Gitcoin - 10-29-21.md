## Summary

In Gitcoin DAO news, the proposal to Integrate dCompass within dGitcoin to build dQuests & dKnowledge has received feedback from the required amount of Stewards 1. The proposal is now live on Snapshot 1 until Nov 7th.

Gitcoin Financial Reporting by Elliot from Llama presented the GitcoinDAO Treasury Report for September 2021. The report is the first out of a series of monthly treasury reports with the ambition to “provide insight into the performance of Gitcoin”. You can read the report <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAEs4t7TzsE/Q2--4jnA6n5W4s9kgsQgzg/view?utm_content=DAEs4t7TzsE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink">here</a>.

Fearless Gitcoin leader Kevin Owocki, authored a thread on Twitter 1 with slides on how “Ethereum is Solarpunk”. The thread describes how “Ethereum is a schelling point for the hopeful” and how it is a “campfire we can rally around, and together, that we can use to create a cyberpunk world AND a solarpunk world.”

## Forum Summary

In Gitcoin Forum news, the discussion around Redistribute GTC to Individuals Who Could Not Claim Due to Error is ongoing with the author Tardigrade continuing to answer questions regarding the proposal.

CrossStream DAOops & Community XP Funding by DisruptionJoe presented options for how the “CrossStream DAOops Governance squad (CSDG), which makes decisions that affect the entire DAO, should be governed”. The thread linked below is a continuation of the conversation started on the FDD Q4 Budget Proposal.

In reference to the Public Goods funding, the first workstream payments have been made to key contributors in the Public Goods workstream. "Formal accounting will be moving into cross-DAO ops in time for the second budget proposal. Progress has been made on onboarding, which will also move into a larger cross-DAO ops initiative," as reported by the Gitcoin DAO.

The dGTC Workstream Q4 Budget Proposal 1 has been posted on the forum by Philip for review. The proposal brings the Data & DevOps project into this workstream. A team to design a sybil score aggregation protocol and build a POC implementation will be added. The workstream is also planning to add community contributors to the dGrants team to increase velocity and scale.
