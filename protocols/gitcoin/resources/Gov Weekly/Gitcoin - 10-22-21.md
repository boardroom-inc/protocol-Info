## Summary

In Gitcoin DAO news, the proposal to ratify the results of GR11 2 has been ratified on Snapshot, the majority vote going towards allowing to pay all grants the amount of match funds from the community multisig as determined by applying QF after removing contributions attributed to accounts flagged as sybil as reported by the GitcoinDAO Digest.

Huxwell gave an update on the Discovery-workstream proposal after two weeks of discussion on the forum. the name of the workstream has now been renamed from Discovery to dCompass.

The Community Experience team that is led by krrisis is making great progress on streamlining cross-DAO operations, onboarding flows, a Notion and Discord rework, and more. In this context, “Gitcoin’s orbit” by Kevin Owocki explores the Gitcoin ecosystem and onboarding by drawing parallels to a solar system. The post also describes what a “DAO of DAOs”-solar system might look like.

MMM also created POAPs for the Public Goods Workstream and the Moonshot Collective. To date, MMM has created and gifted POAPs to more than 50 people for GitcoinDAO related events and roles.

Proposal 2 to ratify the results of Grants Round 11 passed. Payouts start streaming on 10/21/21. DisruptionJoe also authored a Twitter thread on the topic of fraud tax and why it will not be paid out this round.
