## Other Updates

This section of the Weekly Update is for adding anything else members of a DAO need to know. Scribes can format these however they like, but below are some suggestions on the type of things to include:

- Topics discussed in the Discord, with links.
- Twitter threads about the DAO are worth highlighting.
- News mentions of the DAO
- Etc.
