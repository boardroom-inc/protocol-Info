**Gitcoin is a blockchain-based incentivization layer for open source software. It is a community for developers to collaborate and monetize their skills while working on Open Source projects with bounties.**

Governance Process

### About GTC

GTC is a governance token for credibly neutral developer talent and public goods funding, and the means to progressively decentralize the Gitcoin platform through the GitcoinDAO.

At inception, Gitcoin’s DAO will oversee a community treasury of GTC tokens, along with offering a governance framework for delegates (called Gitcoin Stewards) to participate in key ecosystem decisions such as fund allocation, matching pools, and grant collusion.  

GTC is a fork of the COMP/UNI governance systems, built with a delegation prompt built into the retroactive claim process. You may delegate your voting right to a Gitcoin steward, empowering them with your voting rights. We hope this flow will establish our DAO ecosystem with higher voter turnout than any blockchain-based governance system in the past. 

The goal is to gradually introduce more formal frameworks for the ongoing development and maintenance of Gitcoin, as managed through on-chain voting.

### How it Works

[**The full, updated governance process can be found here.**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v2-updated/7860)

The Gitcoin governance ecosystem is built around GTC, which leverages a COMP/UNI style governance that makes on-chain voting, snapshot voting and community led governance possible. At its base layer, GTC is a standard ERC20-style token with a 100mm supply. 50% of the token supply has been allocated to those who have provided value to the ecosystem in the past (community members, investors and the existing team), and 50% will be unlocked for the community to manage in the future.

At launch, GitcoinDAO has an even split between past Gitcoin builders and participants, and future ones. The tokens reserved for future builders will be held in treasury, governed by community stewards and then ultimately the DAO.

GTC has NO economic value, it is a governance token only. It’s contract address is [0xde30da39c46104798bb5aa3fe8b9e0e1f348163f](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde30da39c46104798bb5aa3fe8b9e0e1f348163f).

### Quadratic Lands

While Gitcoin DAO is an end in itself, it is also a means to another end: To chart a course to [Quadratic Lands](https://gitcoin.co/quadraticlands/) — a future-state where communities are empowered to build for the common good, and digital democracy reigns.
