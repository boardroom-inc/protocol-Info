# MolochDAO

Moloch DAO was deployed to the Ethereum blockchain on February 14, 2019. Its goal per the original whitepaper was to “to fund and further the development of public infrastructure related to Eth 2.0.” Since inception, Moloch has awarded ~$700,000 in grants to several Ethereum projects.

MolochDAO has also inspired Moloch members to design alternative funding systems such as Open Grants. The impact of Moloch as a DAO in servitude to Ethereum will be accelerated by funding a synergetic portfolio of projects and by cultivating an ecosystem of builders and thinkers that will collectively help make the projects that the DAO funds successful. That is the power of what a DAO model has to offer, as opposed to a traditional VC or foundation model.

## MolochDAO Shares

All Shares are non-transferable and unique to the DAO.
Each share represents a pro-rata claim on the underlying capital pool and can be exchanged at any time using the Ragequit feature.
There is no cap on the amount of shares that can be issued, and each share carries one vote.
All new shares are issued at current exchange rate and new members may request a maximum of 100 shares when joining.

4. Get involved and do work for the DAO to earn your way in:
[Contact a member of the ReallyBoringGuild to discuss what you can offer](https://molochdao.gitbook.io/handbook/reallyboringguild-member-policies/contributing-to-rbg)

### How do you work your way in?

After providing labor equivalent to one share, members of ReallyBoringGuild will evaluate the efforts of the contributor and may invite them to submit a membership proposal to MolochDAO. The contributor will be required to pay tribute for their share to publicly demonstrate their willingness to sacrifice of themselves for the greater good (and have some skin in the game). This path relies on one’s own initiative and drive to get shit done and prove yourself via blood, sweat, and tears.
If you want to go this route DM @traviswyche or @annwillmott on telegram.

### What do you recommend to get started?

* Read through the mission and values, vision of Web 3, underlying beliefs
* Join the Discord chat and familiarize yourself with the core values
* Explain how you want to get involved!

After becoming a member by one of these three methods, one gains permission to submit proposals to fund projects or create guilds, participate in soft polls, and cast on-chain votes.

## Community Governance

The Moloch DAO v2 smart contract standard is inherently well suited to facilitate the governance goals by virtue of several features: 

### Membership is Permissioned

* Membership Admission is Permissioned: Membership for MolochDAO is a permissioned processes which reflects the wisdom of MolochDAO's existing membership. Before new membership proposals are submitted on-chain and voted on, candidates must first be championed by an existing member of the DAO and undergo internal member-driven evaluation where various aspects of their membership are considered: culture fit, expertise, etc...
* Continuing Membership is Permissioned and Community-Policed: For a person to continue being a member of MolochDAO, that person must implicitly have the consent of an economic majority of MolochDAO members. Any member may at any time propose that another member be expelled from the DAO, and if that proposal is approved by sufficient other members, the person will lose their DAO shares and governance rights while receiving (through the mechanism of RageQuit) payment tokens representing their percentage of MolochDAO's property.

Membership shares, although they can potentially be viewed as "tokens" in a loose sense (because they are intangibles with balances tracked on Ethereum), are non-transferable. 

### Membership Resignation/Reduction is Permissionless

Moloch DAO v2 smart contracts embodies the cypherpunk design principle of "opt-in" and self-sovereign choice, and thus exit from the DAO has been made as easy, trustless and economically riskless as possible. Hence, each DAO member is able to RageQuit at any time with respect to all or any portion of the member's shares and receive payment tokens and claims tokens representing the percentage of the DAO's property to which the member is entitled by virtue of the number of shares the member holds in the DAO.
