# Tokenlon
## Overview
Tokenlon is a decentralized exchange and payment settlement protocol based on Ethereum blockchain technology. It currently powers Tokenlon DEX, a decentralized exchange and payment settlement protocol which aims to provide a secure, reliable and seamless trading experience to the masses.

It leverages the characteristics of decentralized blockchain networks.

*Permissionless:* Anyone can access without permission.
Trustless: Based on smart contracts to be transparent and secure without having to trust a third-party.
Anti-censorship: Based on cryptographic technology that makes value transfer unstoppable.
Robustness: 24/7 uninterrupted, no single point of operation.

With the innovative development of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), we have seen money markets, lending markets, trading markets, payment networks, insurance markets, derivative markets etc. gradually forming a new and open financial ecosystem based on Blockchain. However, many protocols are still evolving, and there are problems in user experience and separated liquidity.

Thanks to the openness, programmability, and composability of smart contracts, Tokenlon will integrate various mature financial protocols within the ecosystem and build a global settlement layer on top of them. Tokenlon will be used as an exchange and payment infrastructure for applications and create a robust and rich global financial market with its ecosystem partners.

We hope that through community building, we will provide developers with a unified and standardized access point to DeFi as well as users with a simple and easy-to-use finance interface, so that everyone can use open financial services freely and equally.

LON, or Tokenlon Network Token, was originally designed to align all parties in the ecosystem, give the community the right to participate in community governance, and work together to promote ecosystem development. As of the fourth week of LON mining, more than 28,000 users have received a total of 4 million LON allocations.

## Governance
With the growing LON community group, the team decided to launch the community governance pilot through Snapshot, invite the community to participate in project decision-making, and gradually open up governance.
