# Protein

## Overview 

We’re Protein, a community of creators, thinkers and doers who believe there’s a better way to grow. We’re building an ecosystem that develops and delivers breakthrough projects. 

### Mission 
#### A place where people and ideas grow.

The term *growth* has become unavoidably toxic in our capitalist world - powered by the extraction and exploitation of people and communities in the name of money.

There is a clear need to subvert the system and enable a stakeholder-led, rather than shareholder-led world. Web3 technologies have opened the doors to a more collaborative, decentralised, and equitable future. 

With these new tools, an opportunity emerges to **reclaim power, redistribute influence, and redefine our relationship with *growth -* allowing you to own the decisions, actions, and value you create**

We're rebuilding our community from the ground up to create a place that encourages and nurtures this new definition of *growth*. It's based on mutual collaboration, conversation, and the needs of our members.

Our Social Token ($PRTN) will power this transformation, allowing you to create value, gain access, take ownership, and be in control - whilst also playing an exciting and important part in the future of **Protein.
