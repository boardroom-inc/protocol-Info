# The LAO

One of the most promising applications of Ethereum is the decentralized (autonomous) organization, also known as a DAO. In 2016, the Ethereum community saw the first great experiment with DAOs with the launch of "The DAO." The DAO raised over $150 million dollars, but it ultimately failed due to legal and technical challenges.

The LAO was organized in the spirit of The DAO, as a member-directed venture capital fund organized in the United States, with an aim to be compliant with U.S. law. Like The DAO, The LAO allows Members to pool capital, invest in projects, and share in any proceeds from the investment.

## How is The LAO structured?
The LAO is organized as a Delaware limited liability company.

The rights and obligations of The LAO members are set forth in an operating agreement (which will be provided when you are verified to contribute to the LAO) and are supplemented by the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. YOU SHOULD RETAIN YOUR OWN COUNSEL FOR PURPOSES OF EVALUATING WHETHER TO JOIN THE LAO AS A MEMBER.

At its core, The LAO will be member-managed and rely on a DApp and related smart contracts to facilitate investments into projects using digital assets.

Unlike The DAO, which was arguably an implied partnership that provided members with limited legal protection, The LAO's operating agreement expressly limits the members' liability and limits any fiduciary obligations amongst members, in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

## How do members of The LAO make investment decisions?
In the spirit of The DAO, The LAO is entirely member directed and managed and any blockchain-based project can apply for funding from The LAO. As a member, you should have some experience in evaluating and investing in startups relying on digital assets.

Each member will have the opportunity to nominate any applicant for funding through the DApp. Once nominated, members or their delegates will have the right to vote on whether to invest in a project through the DApp.

If more members agree vote for an investment than reject an investment during the applicable voting period, The Members will authorize the investment. After a seven day period to enable Members to "rage quit," The LAO DApp will generate the necessary legal agreements and send them to a designated representative for signature. Once digitally signed, The LAO will transfer the investment to the project.

## How can I contribute to The LAO and become a member?
Membership in The LAO is currently limited to accredited investors, as defined under U.S. law. The total number of members will be capped at a maximum of 99 members.

Members have the opportunity to contribute Ether to The LAO by purchasing units representing an ownership in The LAO ("LAO Units"). The members reserve the right to create a LAO Token to represent LAO Units via a Member votes.

Units are sold in blocks. Each block of LAO Units (or 100,000 units) is currently being sold for 310 ETH and provide a member with 0.9% of the voting rights in The LAO, along with 0.9% pro rata rights to any proceeds from investments. The per unit number to buy units into The LAO will increase incrementally after every investment The LAO makes.

Each member is be permitted to purchase up to nine blocks of LAO Units (or 7.2% in total).

The sale will be denominated in Ether. Ether to US dollar calculations will be provided via a real time oracle feed from Chainlink.
