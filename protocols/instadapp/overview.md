# InstaDAPP
## Overview
Instadapp is the open source DeFi-Middleware for Ethereum and EVM related networks. Instadapp code changes and other decisions are made by the INST tokenholders. Governance varies from voting on decisions around the protocols objectives and directives, to specific changed made to the codebase, or allocation Treasury and other resources.

## Governance 
Any user can create or suggest a proposal, proposals do not need to be complete ideas but should develop into a more formal proposal that the community can vote on. Users are encouraged to engage the community on the governance forum and on Discord.  Submit code changes for the team to review, or request the team to develop a particular idea.

### On-Chain / Off-Chain Voting
Instadapp Governance utilizes both on-chain and off-chain voting mechanisms. Currently on-chain is utilized for submitting upgrades to the protocol which require on-chain vote to be submitted with code for upgrading the protocol. For non-critical code changes and other proposals that do not involve code changes, governance can also utilize Snapshot.

There may be some changes or discrepancies between on-chain/off-chain voting, the INST tokenholders may change how they utilize off-chain voting, but currently off-chain voting holds the same parameters as on-chain voting, meaning off-chain votes must achieve quorum.

**Governance Execution (Implementing Changes)**
The INST token contract utilized the COMP token contract as a base contract. The INST contracts currently follow the 3-Day voting/2-Day time-lock functionality but this can be adjusted by the community. The INST contracts utilize proxy-contracts to upgrade the DeFi Smart Layer contracts.

*The use and utilization of off-chain voting is subject to change, and should be reviewed by the community periodically*
