# DappGoose Labs

A decentralized R&D studio and creative collective focused on builing projects, publishing research, etc. that make the Web 3.0, NFT, and DeFi ecosystem simpler to enter for newcomers, and more efficient to navigate for those already here.

## Overview 
- Currently, we're working on NFThub, the Nifty Pride Foundation, and Club 90nine; each have their own individual governance, but they are all projects in which our core contributors overlap. 

## Governance 
- Currently, we're using a couple of different platforms for governance; as we're just establishing the DAO and exploring which system works best for our needs. 
- Both onchain and offchain via SuperDAO and Snapshot; as well as likely summoning a Moloch. 
- Our governance utilizes NFTs instead of ERC-20s; the NFTs are issued 1 per member and are non-transferrable. Should someone leave or be removed, we retain the ability to burn their NFT. 
- Proposals are first discussed in one of our communication channels, and put to vote after receiving enough community/contributor support.

## Join our DAO
- To  join the DAO, one would need to complete an application form, or be referred by an existing member. 
- The steps for joining are quite simple; either complete an application and onboarding call, or be referred by a member; in which case contributors vote on approval.
- There are a couple small pre-requisites; we expect applicants to be passionate about the decentralized web, and committed to being self-driven when volunteering for, or accepting bounties for tasks and day-to-day upkeep.
