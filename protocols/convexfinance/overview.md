# Convex Finance

## Overview

Convex allows Curve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without locking CRV themselves. Liquidity providers can receive boosted CRV and liquidity mining rewards with minimal effort.

If you would like to stake CRV, Convex lets users receive trading fees as well as a share of boosted CRV received by liquidity providers. This allows for a better balance between liquidity providers and CRV stakers as well as better capital efficiency.

Convex has no withdrawal fees and minimal performance fees which is used to pay for gas and distributed to CVX stakers.
CRV stakers and liquidity providers also receive liquidity mining rewards in the form of CVX.

## Governance

The Curve system allows veCRV holders to vote how CRV inflation is distributed by assigning weights to each pool's "gauge".
As a holder of veCRV, Convex Finance can participate in these voting procedures, and these voting rights are passed to vote locked CVX holders.

### Voting Rules and Information:
- Voting will be done via Snapshot.
- Gauge weight votes will be bi-weekly, starting Thursdays at 00:00 UTC and ending on Tuesdays 00:00 UTC. 
- Other Curve.fi governance votes will be addressed as they arise.
- Curve ownership governance votes will have a quorum of 20%; Curve parameter governance votes will have a quorum of 10%; gauge weight votes will not have a quorum.
- Individual CVX holders may spread their votes among multiple pools in gauge weight votes.
- Each gauge will have a hard cap of 50% of Convex's veCRV assigned to it. Overflow will be distributed to other pools in proportion to their vote weight.
- Each gauge must receive at least 0.10% of the votes before weight is assigned.
- CRV paired gauges will have a hard cap of 20%.
- All non-Ethereum gauge weight will have a combined total cap of 10%.  Overflow will be distributed to other pools in proportion to their vote weight.
