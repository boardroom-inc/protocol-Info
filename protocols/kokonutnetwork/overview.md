# Kokonut Network

Kokonut Network is a platform built by the people, for the people. At its core, Kokonut DAO looks to empower anyone adding value to the Kokonut Network ecosystem, regardless of their social status or previous accolades.

## Overview

Kokonut Network brings blockchain governance and open-source accounting, to the agriculture industry. Kokonut Network promotes, organizes, funds, and manages coconut farms. We gather funds from the community using the DAOHaus framework for decision-making and project development funds allocation.

When you mix agriculture + blockchain + web3 + perfect weather, and soil, this formula allows us to create an amazing investment opportunity that doesn't have an expiration date. The formula allows us to offer a lifetime partnership. We achieve this by replanting the coconut trees once they stop bearing fruits, a one-time contribution equals a lifetime of rewards and benefits.

## Rage Quitting = Leaving Kokonut DAO

At any time any DAO member can rage-quit to obtain a proportional percentage of the Kokonut DAO Bank assets.

- If unfavorable circumstances require that a member sell their shares or loot they can submit a proposal to sell them to another Kokonut DAO Member or another address approved by Kokonut DAO members. This would require two proposals: one to rage-quit current shares and/or loot and one to mint new shares and/or for a current member. This would need two Kokonut DAO votes to support.
- Contributors can enforce governance through Rage-quit to remove their donations at any time if they are not comfortable with the direction of Kokonut DAO.
- Members should Rage-quit if the core team is not conducting the business program defined in funding proposals.
