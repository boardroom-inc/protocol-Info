# Algodao

AlgoDAO is an open community-owned and community-led DAO focused on providing access to funding, resources and support to blockchain developers interested in building on the Algorand blockchain.

## Overview

DAO is a generally broad term and AlgoDAO is a DAO in the sense that it is a community-owned and community-driven project managed with smart contracts and shaped by community proposals. What differentiates AlgoDAO from the broad DAO sector is that AlgoDAI is functionally an accelerator managed as a DAO. 

Another important feature that differentiates AlgoDAO is a dual-token model that gives members a SIGMA pool allocation exposure to every project that goes through Algodao irrespective of the size of their ADAO stake.

## Governance

The governance token for AlgoDAO is called ADAO.

### ADAO Tokenomics

AlgoDAO has a unique dual-token tokenomics that includes the ADAO token and the SIGMA token. 

#### ADAO’s Core Utility 

ADAO is the governance token of AlgoDAO. Staking ADAO enters you to membership in AlgoDAO’s Federation tier, and the membership entitles you to participate on funding rounds and to receive rewards from SIGMA pool. You can also delegate ADAO to become a High Council member. Your membership tier determines your maximum price allocation, how early you can participate in funding rounds, and the price in which you join the rounds. 

#### SIGMA Token’s Core Utility 

The SIGMA token is the utility token of AlgoDAO’s SIGMA pool. Burning the SIGMA token entitles you to a pro-rata share of the SIGMA pool so you can get project tokens from projects launched through AlgoDAO.

#### Token Distribution 

ADAO’s token distribution is designed to align the interests of all ADAO participants, elicit maximum commitment, and demonstrate an understanding of sound economic principles and behavioral science.
