# Braintrust

## Overview
Braintrust is the first decentralized talent network that connects skilled, vetted knowledge workers with the world’s most reputable brands. The community that relies on Braintrust to find work are the same people who own and build it, ensuring the network always serves the needs of its users, instead of a centrally-controlled corporation. Unlike other marketplaces that take 20% to 40% of talent earnings, Braintrust allows talent to keep 100% of earnings and enables clients to make their budgets go further by cutting out the unnecessary middle men.
The community expands beyond 50,000 members across 100+ countries. Braintrust partners with global enterprises including Nestle, Porsche, Atlassian, Goldman Sachs, and Nike. Braintrust is backed by Tiger Global, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera, and Multicoin Capital along with a contingent of individual investors. 


## Governance

### The Token-Enabled BTRST Governance Model 
The Braintrust governance process is comprised of three key components: 

**Smart Contracts:** Anything on-chain can ultimately be subject to a distributed governance process. 

**A Multistage Stakeholder Proposal Process:** Forked and adapted from the Compound Protocol, this serves as the official method of proposal submission, consideration, amendment, and approval. Proposals can begin either as open text or code to be considered and discussed by the ensemble of stakeholders; they are then ultimately subject to a formal, on-chain vote. Following a period of community examination, ultimate implementation and deployment of approved, coded proposals are expected to be overseen by the community’s representatives of freelancers, talent agencies, and clients from around the world that want to further the vision of growing decentralized talent networks. 

- On-chain voting happens on the Braintrust platform (Voting Portal), but is ungated and visible  to any community member for participation or observation.

**Off-Chain Discussion Environments:** Modeled after Uniswap’s approach to community engagement, these serve as non-binding channels for discussion and debate that are critical to reaching both (off-chain) consensus and (on-chain) approval. Discussion occurs within the Braintrust Discord server. Off-chain voting occurs on the Braintrust Snapshot page.


### Voting in Braintrust’s Proposal System 

Areas of decision-making in Braintrust’s governance are substantial in scope and include changes to network fees, the reputation system, technical parameters, governance processes, and token reserve management. 

Changes to the areas noted above are made via an on-chain proposal system, adapted from the Compound fork. Over the long term, the governance of the Braintrust network is expected to increasingly decentralize via community-driven governance as well as on-chain governance activities. Another area of exploration for the Braintrust governance system is quadratic voting, which has proven to be an effective scheme for keeping incentives aligned between users of the network and other token holders.

##  Decentralized Dispute Resolution 

Proposals include contract code that can be implemented automatically and without Braintrust’s direct intervention. The voting results are recorded. In the case of a disagreement about invoices and payments, Community-Adjudicated Dispute Resolution gives decision-making power to the community. The Dispute Resolution Program is made up of Jury Members and a Jury Arbitrator. 

Jury Members can be any BTRST token holder.  Should a dispute require a judgment, three Jury Members are randomly selected from the pool to weigh in on the decision. In addition, Jury Members may be called to be eyewitnesses. Eyewitnesses weigh in on subjective statements based on their expertise. For example, a claimant may say something like: “The content writer should have been able to complete more output based on the time he invoiced me.” Three eyewitnesses would be called to make a judgment on that statement as to whether it was reasonable or unreasonable. 

Jury Members serve a one-year term and are self-volunteered. Another crucial member of the Dispute Resolution Program is the Jury Arbitrator. Jury Arbitrators are elected through the off-chain Braintrust governance process and serve a 6 month term. They do not issue rulings but walk claimants and disputants through the process, organize the claims and counterclaims, recruit eyewitnesses, and randomly assign Jury Members to serve for a specific claim.
