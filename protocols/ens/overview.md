# Ethereum Name Service
The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.
ENS’s job is to map human-readable names like ‘alice.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.

## ENS Governance
Proposals follow three basic steps:
 1. Temperature check. Post to the worksteam's Temp Check category to get feedback on your idea before creating a formal proposal.
2. Draft proposal. Create a draft proposal using the [proposal builder](https://discuss.ens.domains/w/proposal-builder/steps/step_1) and solicit feedback on it.
3. Active Proposal. Ask a moderator to move your mature draft to the Active Proposals category and start a vote.

Please read our complete [governance process documentation](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/readme) before starting on your first proposal.
