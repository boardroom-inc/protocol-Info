mStable is a Decentralised Stablecoin Ecosystem composed of a capital-efficient AMM and a high-yielding savings account product. mStable is an autonomous and non-custodial infrastructure for pegged-value crypto assets. 
It is as well as a community-driven platform powered by the $MTA token.

**mStable Improvement Proposals**

mStable Improvement Proposals (MIPs) describe standards for the mStable platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.
An MIP is a proposal to update some function or standard within the mStable ecosystem. MIPs can vary widely from proposing new mStable products, to requesting funds from the mStable Treasury, to performing mStable smart contract upgrades. 
Currently, Meta Governors are responsible for deciding which settings and parameters the mStable protocol implements via MIPs and MCCPs. Meta Governors are also responsible for deciding where mStableâ€™s Meta treasury is allocated. Both of these decision-making processes are now ratified by the ProtocolDAO and mStableDAO respectively.
MIPs proposal process largely follows the same behavior as Ethereum's EIP process.


**mStable governance process**

MTA is mStable's governance token. It has a few main functions, especially to coordinate decentralised governance. 
MTA has a total supply of 100,000,000 tokens.

A brief overview of mStable 4-steps voting process

1. MIP draft
2. ProtocolDAO vote, optimistically a couple of days
3. Forum MIP post, roughly a week
4. Snapshot vote, roughly a week

This process is about to change soon to an even more decentralized one
