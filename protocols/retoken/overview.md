# Mission

REtoken DAO aims to:
1. Become recognized as “The Real Estate DAO”
2. Create a recurring multilingual educational virtual summit that will be delivered for free
3. Develop a 3-tiered Fractionalized Real Estate certificate program that provide CEUs (Continuing Education Unit)
4. Bring liquidity to the traditionally illiquid real estate market through tokenization and community development; and
5. Become the most prominent and globally recognized Real Estate Tokenization / Security Token brand.

# Founding Principles
* Community Owned and Operated
* Full transparency
* Best Practices: Find, Implement, and Refine
* We will be intentional about developing win / win / win projects

# REtoken DAO | Season 0 / 1

## What is a “Season”?
A season is an agreed upon window of time when members can align on projects that help us in achieving our broader mission.

## Season 0 | Genesis
During this initial season we are laying a solid foundation while being intently focused on delivering value to our members.

## Season 1 | Initial DEX Offering (IDO) Listing
When $RETOKEN becomes listed on a DEX (UniSwap, SushiSwap, HoneySwap, Acala, etc), this will initiate season 1.

# Governance Process

## Board of Stewards
The community has agreed to “roadmap” implementing a [Board of Stewards (BoS) (see write up on SporkDAO)](https://forum.sporkdao.org/t/sporkdao-board-of-stewards-role/53). We anticipate that this process will occur within Season 0 with the expectation that the BoS will initiate efforts and planning migration into Season 1.

The Board of Stewards' primary responsibility is to help the DAO operate smoothly and efficiently so that REtoken DAO will be a catalyst for disrupting the Real Estate industry with Blockchain Technology.
