# GoodKarma DAO

## Overview

Good Karma Records is a community-owned record label committed to elevating the next era of artists. It‚Äôs backed by a shared treasury to launch exclusive NFT projects, host live events, and remove label power structures to help artists grow and thrive in Web3. Good Karma Records empowers Web3 artist communities, builds deeper relationships between fans, and provides deals that fairly serve both parties. Everything is governed by the $KARMA token - used to vote on how to run the label.

### How does it work ?
When you sign with Good Karma, you receive your own artist token. Your fans can invest in your success by buying your token, like buying stock. We‚Äôll promote distribute your token to the community. You receive money (that you don‚Äôt have to pay back) and your buyers have a stake in your success. Over the course of the contract, we‚Äôll advertise and market your music, plan and promote NFT drops, book shows, and develop your craft. As you grow as an artist, so does the value of the token. Everybody wins. üçæüçæüçæ

Sound pretty great? We think it‚Äôs game-changing. The best part is that A&R‚Äôs no longer have keys to your castle. The community is at your fingertips and we can‚Äôt wait to hear your sound.
