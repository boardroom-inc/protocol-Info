# Akropolis

## Overview
Akropolis’s mission is to give everyone the tools to save, grow and provision for the future safely and without dependence on a central counterparty, or to fall prey to predatory financial practices of multiple intermediaries. 

Our goal is to create yield-generating products that don’t predominantly rely on inflationary emissions as the main source of yield and that generate returns regardless of the market conditions.

Our current products include:
- Vortex - An on-chain basis trading strategy that aims to generate long-term, sustainable and rewarding yields while remaining market-neutral.
- yVaults - Streamlined and simplified access to select Yearn vaults to optimize yields.

Akropolis is the one-stop solution for any investor seeking access to passive, efficient and sustainable yield generation.

### AKRO Tokenomics
> Tokenomics are evolving and subject to change
#### Token Utility
AKRO is a governance token that grants holders the right to raise and participate in decisions that affect Akropolis. This protocol-level governance is tied to managing the suite of DeFi products built on Akropolis.
AKRO stakers also receive returns from protocol revenue and additional AKRO emissions.

## Governance

### High-Level Summary
* Initial Governance will be done through the [Akropolis snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/akropolis.eth)
* Active AKRO stakers will be able to post proposals and vote on them.
### What can I signal my vote on?
* Product features and integrations
* Product fees
* Strategy proposals
### How do I vote?
* Go to the  on Snapshot;
* Click on “Connect wallet” button in top right corner;
* Connect to the wallet which you use for staking of AKRO ;
* Click on the option you want to vote for;
* Sign the message via your wallet and done.
* Voting will be open for 3 days or 72 hours, so if it opens on Wed 1300CET, it will close on Friday 1300CET (approximately, as closing time is set by the block number).
### Governance Workflow:
* All proposals should first be discussed over the  and in Discord. That would give all governance participants an ability to understand all pros & cons before voting.
* The team will assign time values (i.e. urgent vs non-urgent, pending, etc) to titles based on our discretion.
* For feature requests please name your proposal AFR+n (i.e. third proposal is named AFR-003).
* For governance proposals AIP+n (i.e. third proposal is named AIP-003).
* After the initial discussion is completed & community (including team) agree that it should be officially voted on — team or community members can post it on Snapshot page for voting. And as it’s off-chain voting, it does not require any gas fees.
* After voting is completed & proposal reaches 10% quorum, we will add it to our development pipeline.
> If quorum is not reached, the proposal might be resubmitted for voting after 7 days cooldown.
### Who can create or vote on proposals?
* Only AKRO stakers can create or vote for proposals. This way we ensure that only active users have a say in Akropolis governance.
* 1 vote equals 1 AKRO staked.
* There is a minimum of 25M AKRO to create a proposal on Snapshot.
* There is no minimum for voting.
