# LootDAO 

Loot is randomized adventurer gear generated and stored on chain. Stats, images, and other functionality are intentionally omitted for others to interpret. Feel free to use Loot in any way you want.

## Overview

### What is Loot?
Loot is a collection of 8,000 unique bags of adventurer gear, originally released by Dom Hofmann. At release, anyone could claim loot bags for just gas, and all bags were claimed in under 4 hours. Each loot bag contains 8 items: a piece for an adventurer's chest, foot, hand, head, neck, ring, waist, and weapon.

Loot is an unaudited project. Bags #1 to #7777 were claimable by anyone and #7778 to #8000 are currently reserved for the contract deployer.

### Why is loot special?
Loot is unique—the first project of its kind. With no company, art, team, or attributes, Loot makes it impossible to gate-keep any creative decisions (h/t @john_c_palmer).

Loot is the unfiltered, uncensorable building block for stories, experiences, games, and more, in the hands of the community, at no cost. Loot pursues complete decentralization from day one.

### Can I build with Loot?
Yes, you are free to use Loot in any way you want. For inspiration, see existing resources put together by the community.

### Am I priced out of loot?
Not at all. Through Synthetic Loot, all addresses have access to virtual Loot that developers can integrate into the Loot projects they build.

Thus, anyone with an Ethereum wallet is allowed to participate in the ecosystem, while still maintaining distinction between original Loot and synthetics.

### How do I value Loot bags?
They say that value is always in the eye of the beholder. Loot is no different, with no explicit rarities specified at launch. How you value a loot bag is up to you.

Still, the community has begun to devise many mechanisms by which to assess the rarity of bags and their items. Some of these include rarity by occurence or item score.

Remember, use your own discretion when valuing a loot bag.
