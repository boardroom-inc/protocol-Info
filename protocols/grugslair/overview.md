# *Grug’s Lair DAO*

## Overview

Grug's Lair DAO is a community owned Playfi Guild and trading DAO that will allow both P2E and crypto trading enthusiasts to take part in the activities that we will offer in the Discord group.

The main goal of the Grug’s Lair is to create an innovative and welcoming space for people that are interested in many areas of crypto and blockchains, mainly focusing on PlayFi/ Play to Earn Gaming. We aim to solve one of the biggest barriers in blockchain gaming by providing members of the Lair with scholarships for the games that the DAO will support, removing the need for the members to actually own expensive gaming assets and introducing a unique revenue model for the scholar, asset owner and DAO.

### Who is Grug?

Grug is a contrarian by nature, the first prisoner emerging from the cave and venturing into the unknown; embracing the molten ball of knowledge spawned by the big bang. Since doing so, he has unleashed something that was always innate, but dormant; an insatiable thirst for knowledge and truth.
