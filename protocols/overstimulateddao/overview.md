## Overstimulate DAO by Daniel Allan


Overstimulated comments on the overwhelming nature of my personal journey. When life gets hectic, my coping mechanism is music. Sometimes I don`t know how to communicate, so I suppose this is my way of sharing that experience with the world.

## Motivation

The decision to release Overstimulated as a community-owned DAO was simple.

1. Retain creative control.
1. Remove the creative bottleneck.
1. Find a new avenue for building community.
1. Experiment with a new way to fund a release.
1. Raise working capital without selling ownership to a major label.
1. Explore what a crypto-native EP looks like.

This would be (to his knowledge) the first music crypto-funded crowdfund, which would offer great exposure to the space and encourage other artists to pursue independence.

As he looks to make an impact in web3, He wants to explore a novel funding mechanism to truly engage fans and experiment with community governance.


## Governance

Overstimulated is community-owned, representing the master rights to the artist share of the project. The Mirror crowdfund raised 50 ETH, and backers received Overstimulated NFTs and $OVERSTIM tokens for their support.

Overstimulated is a DAO governed by the $OVERSTIM token.

The project (available on Discord) is a 6 track journey through my head.

1. Stuck
1. Feel Like That (with Idarose)
1. Say What You Want (with Deegan)
1. Really Cool (with Deegan)
1. Poison (with DLG.)
1. Too Close (with bloody white)
