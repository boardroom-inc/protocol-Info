Repeated calls for a vote regarding whether the fee switch should be turned on or not.

Update:\
[Post from HarvardLawBFI](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/fee-switch-date-approaching-time-to-act/10418/50) raising important questions and subdiscussions around (1) Which liquidity pools in v2 should be turned on?
(2) In the event we do turn fee switch on, should we turn it on completely to 0.5 or start with a test at, for example, 0.3? (3) What is the best mechanism to reward UNI holders after turning the switch on?

In parallel, there are [concerns](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/what-do-you-think-of-the-initial-airdrop/11164/23) as to how uniswap can outcompete other exchanges given similar capabilities.
