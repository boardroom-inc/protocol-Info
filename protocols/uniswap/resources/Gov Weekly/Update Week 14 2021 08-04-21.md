| Can UGP increase their Q2 budget to $1.5M? | Treasury | [Vote](https://app.boardroom.info/uniswap/poll/QmWe6Krc81pkCtQFbd2AxytFCp1imLGUnFTEEom9YNwFte) |

Summary:\
The UNI Grants Program would like to double the Q2 budget to $1.5M in order to match the Uniswap Labs bug bounty program with $500,000 worth of UNI from the Committee multisig. Due to the price change of UNI, the funds are already available and will not require a formal transfer of funds from community treasury.\
However, as these funds were not a part of our original proposal, we are seeking approval via a 7 day time-bound Snapshot vote, after which UGP will act according to the majority vote.

Outcome: Vote Passed

| Add SNX/ETH pool to list of pools eligible for UNI rewards | Product/Development | [Discuss](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/add-snx-eth-pool-to-list-of-pools-eligible-for-uni-rewards/3286) |

Summary:
SNX is an important collateral asset within the DeFi ecosystem, it currently secures nearly $150 million USD worth of synthetic assets on Ethereum. Greater liquidity for SNX makes it easier for stakers to manage their debt obligations and for the entire system to stay sufficiently collateralized, both of which in turn make DeFiâ€™s largest pool of synthetic asset liquidity more efficient.

Update:\
Despite ample support, some pushback through [arguments](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/add-snx-eth-pool-to-list-of-pools-eligible-for-uni-rewards/3286/12) that SNX brings additional value to the exchange as a bridge asset
