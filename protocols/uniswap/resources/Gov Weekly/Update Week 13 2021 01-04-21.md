| Can UGP increase their Q2 budget to $1.5M? |  | [Vote](https://app.boardroom.info/uniswap/poll/QmWe6Krc81pkCtQFbd2AxytFCp1imLGUnFTEEom9YNwFte) |

Summary:\
The UNI Grants Program would like to double the Q2 budget to $1.5M in order to match the Uniswap Labs bug bounty program with $500,000 worth of UNI from the Committee multisig. Due to the price change of UNI, the funds are already available and will not require a formal transfer of funds from community treasury.\
However, as these funds were not a part of our original proposal, we are seeking approval via a 7 day time-bound Snapshot vote, after which UGP will act according to the majority vote.

Closes: April 3rd
