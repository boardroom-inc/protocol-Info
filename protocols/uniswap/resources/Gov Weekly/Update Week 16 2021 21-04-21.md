| Fee switch date approaching, time to act | Product | [Discuss](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/fee-switch-date-approaching-time-to-act/10418) |

Summary:
Repeated calls for a vote regarding whether the fee switch should be turned on or not.

Update 1:\
[Post from HarvardLawBFI](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/fee-switch-date-approaching-time-to-act/10418/50) raising important questions and subdiscussions around (1) Which liquidity pools in v2 should be turned on?
(2) In the event we do turn fee switch on, should we turn it on completely to 0.5 or start with a test at, for example, 0.3? (3) What is the best mechanism to reward UNI holders after turning the switch on?

Update 2:\
[Pushback](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/fee-switch-date-approaching-time-to-act/10418/53) as to why making Uniswap V2 a worse product for LPs and traders by turning fee switch on is superior to distributing the treasury that is meant to be distributed. Concerns that if treasury is not distributed at a decent enough pace, Uniswap governance becomes more centralized to investors and the team due to the vesting schedule.
