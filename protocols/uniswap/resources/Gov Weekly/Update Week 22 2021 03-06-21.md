| Deploy Uniswap V3 on Polygon/Matic | Strategy | [Discuss](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-polygon-matic/12165) |

Summary:\
Discussion in support of deploying V3 on Polygon as well as Optimism

Update 1:\
Aside from ample [support](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-polygon-matic/12165/7),
there are [questions](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-polygon-matic/12165/7) regarding Polygon's security and if it represents a concern for the Uni team as to deploying on polygon.

Update 2:\
Following ample support for deployment on Polygon, [questions](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-polygon-matic/12165/23) raised by argument that Polygon is ultimately more of a competitor to Ethereum than an ethereum friendly option.

Update 3:\
With both support and pushback from the community, there are [calls](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-polygon-matic/12165/21) to move to off-chain polling.
