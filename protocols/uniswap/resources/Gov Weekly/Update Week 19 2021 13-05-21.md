| UNI should become an oracle token | Strategy/Tokenomics | [Discuss](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uni-should-become-an-oracle-token/11988) |

Summary:\
Discussion post by Vitalik alerts two problems.\
(1) Algorithmic stablecoins need an oracle for the price of ETH/USD to function;
they need an oracle for USD (the off-chain fiat asset) and not on-chain instantiations of USD.\
(2) Synthetic assets need an oracle for the price of ETH denominated in whatever asset they are mirroring.

To solve this it proposes that Uniswap and the UNI token step in and provides an oracle that is specialized to providing price data thatâ€™s robust and extremely costly to manipulate and attack.

Update 1: \
Significant [pushback](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uni-should-become-an-oracle-token/11988/3) from multiple users who believe Chainlink is better equiped to address issue

Update 2: \
[Arguments](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uni-should-become-an-oracle-token/11988/19) for [unique value](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uni-should-become-an-oracle-token/11988/52) of Uni oracle as opposed to Chainlink

| Fee switch date approaching, time to act | Meta/Fees | [Discuss](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/fee-switch-date-approaching-time-to-act/10418) |

Summary:
Repeated calls for a vote regarding whether the fee switch should be turned on or not.

Update 1:\
[Post from HarvardLawBFI](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/fee-switch-date-approaching-time-to-act/10418/50) raising important questions and subdiscussions around (1) Which liquidity pools in v2 should be turned on?
(2) In the event we do turn fee switch on, should we turn it on completely to 0.5 or start with a test at, for example, 0.3? (3) What is the best mechanism to reward UNI holders after turning the switch on?

Update 2:\
[Pushback](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/fee-switch-date-approaching-time-to-act/10418/53) as to why making Uniswap V2 a worse product for LPs and traders by turning fee switch on is superior to distributing the treasury that is meant to be distributed. Concerns that if treasury is not distributed at a decent enough pace, Uniswap governance becomes more centralized to investors and the team due to the vesting schedule.

Update 2:\
Further [calls](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/fee-switch-date-approaching-time-to-act/10418/56) to turn fee switch on - Increasing value of this measure with V3

| Taxation, taxes | Development | [Discuss]() |

Summary:
Discussion advocating to transparently track and organize transaction history for user

Update:\
Despite [pushback](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/taxation-taxes/11737/3) arguing that the very nature of ethereum tracks and makes transactions public (i.e. Etherscan) there are also favorable [suggestions](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/taxation-taxes/11737/8) that making a transaction history more legible and user friendly may encourage adoption of Uniswap.
