[October 6th Discussion](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uni-default-list/14407) to create proposal to refresh the Uniswap Default token list
	
[September 15th Discussion](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-to-refresh-the-uniswap-default-list/14178) to refresh the token list in addition to removing unsupported or out of date tokens

#### *A discussion has taken place twice to refresh the Uniswap token*
- Currently Uniswap uses Gemini 2 token lists. They haven't been updated for half a year, nor does the community have direct control over it, unlike with default one
- Its time for the community to provide the protocol with an awesome token list it deserves that is curated in a decentralised and fair manner
- Also Optimism and Arbitrum network lists are maintained by optimism ethereum and offchain labs accordingly
