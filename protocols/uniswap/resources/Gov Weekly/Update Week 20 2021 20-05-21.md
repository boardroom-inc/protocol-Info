| UNI should become an oracle token | Strategy/Tokenomics | [Discuss](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uni-should-become-an-oracle-token/11988) |

Summary:\
Discussion post by Vitalik alerts two problems.\
(1) Algorithmic stablecoins need an oracle for the price of ETH/USD to function;
they need an oracle for USD (the off-chain fiat asset) and not on-chain instantiations of USD.\
(2) Synthetic assets need an oracle for the price of ETH denominated in whatever asset they are mirroring.

To solve this it proposes that Uniswap and the UNI token step in and provides an oracle that is specialized to providing price data thatâ€™s robust and extremely costly to manipulate and attack.

Update 1: \
Significant [pushback](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uni-should-become-an-oracle-token/11988/3) from multiple users who believe Chainlink is better equiped to address issue

Update 2: \
[Arguments](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uni-should-become-an-oracle-token/11988/19) for [unique value](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uni-should-become-an-oracle-token/11988/52) of Uni oracle as opposed to Chainlink

Update 3: \
[Reiterations](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uni-should-become-an-oracle-token/11988/77) of the divergent nature of this project to Uni's original intention.
The concern, however, are paralleled by a recognition of the value such a project could potentially add to UNI

| Uniswap Governance Powers in v3 | Parameters | [Discuss](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-governance-powers-in-v3/11812) |

Summary:
Brief summary of governance changes coming with V3 with a focus on fees and fee switch. The initial post requests further discussion on Deciding fee strategy for Uniswap v2 and v3, and Handling assets accumulated from fees.

Update:\
Support for turning Fee Switch on, [arguing](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-governance-powers-in-v3/11812/16) the particularly good timing for such an action.
