### <p align="center"> *New Weekly Update for Uniswap from Mark Priddy - October 4th - October 8th 2021*


 ## Discord Announcements 

- The Rubic team has successfully finished the integration of Uniswap v3. 
	
- This integration will enable users to have better rates and find better liquidity sources directly at [Rubic.exchange](https://rubic.exchange/)
	
- [More information here](https://cryptorubic.medium.com/uniswap-v3-is-now-live-at-rubic-exchange-717dadb6c76b)
	
- New Proposal
	- The "*Tuner*", a Uniswap v3 Simulator  - a simulation mimicing historical Uniswap V3 data in javascript
	- [Github Documentation available here](https://github.com/Bella-DeFinTech/uniswap-v3-simulator/blob/f3476f1f827c996bbe7fc5d489db945b869e0ba3/README.md)

## Governance
	
**Topic 1.** Should Uniswap spend 500k to sponsor an offline event and have reps from the community in the event?
	
**Topic 2.** Helping liquidity providers using historical data with a new solution - Introduction to the “Tuner, a Uniswap V3 Simulator”	

	
## Summary
	
### **Topic 1**
	
- Discussing the proposal for Uniswap to sponsor the [Permissionless Conference in Miami for 500k](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-uniswap-purchases-presenting-sponsorship-spot-at-permissionless-the-worlds-largest-defi-conference/14249)



- More on Event [here](https://app.hubspot.com/documents/4605099/view/251776995?accessId=c3ef87)
	
	- large conference focused on networking - Miami 

- Agreed that this is a bit much compared to the usual 50k or 100k issued in hackathons

- Confirmed Uniswap already sponsors Bankless and they are participating in the event
	


### **Topic 2**
	
- Moving forward, How does governance issue conference tickets fairly to participating member?
	
*As a reminder, Uniswap Grants and Uniswap Governance and separate decision making entities*
	
  - Possibly reworking the tier of rewards in the future for conference sponsorship proposals if the sponsorship will be rewarding the community members
	
Airbayer from Bankless DAO will be presenting in the next community call

	
	
> The *Tuner* tool creates a way to not have to hit an API numerous times to run a test - instead they will be able to test V3 behavior in javascript. This is a way to back task a strategy. The simulator mimics precise historical/ mathematical modeling for outlining a strategy. It's important to have something with more accuracy like this tool in order to test specific events using Uniswap V3. 



- The tool mimics smart contract logic from V3 in javascript

- Running unit test against new simulator to make sure its consistent with the original smart contract

- 1-2 pools are being tested with about 12,000 roles

- Not running through EVM, just replicated the behavior of the smart contract running on V3

- Uniswap needs a high precision and accurate tools in the form on this simulator to perform back tasks

- As far as testing and early stage goes, why not simulate in javascript in the development stage?

- Able to simulate on a higher level using a token amount but don't have restrictions on the token standard while simulating

- Able to do statistical analysis between different timelines among different trading strategies
	
	- In the future building a platform that allow investors choose to invest based on various
