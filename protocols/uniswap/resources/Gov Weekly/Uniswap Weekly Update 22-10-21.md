- Still continuing to work on providing easier ways for grantees to give updates on their output and progress

### 3 Topics on Agenda

*1st topic presented by member of the [Bankless DAO](https://discord.com/invite/bankless) Airbayer*
	
- Bankless DAO created an index and is looking to promote it
- [Bed Index](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bankless-bed-index) is compromised ETH, BTC, and DPI
- DPI index is comprised of 17 different major defi protocol assets
  - Index within an index
  - Purpose is to be crypto friendly and serve as a way for new users to fall in love with crypto
  - Exposure to three different assets and index balances each month
  - Utilizing the social capital that the Bankless DAO shares by using the Bed Index

*Questions*

- How is the index rebalanced?
  - Rebalanced at the close of the first Friday. 
  - Components will be rebalanced based on what assets are performing better. 
  - Getting further details on where the rebalancing is actually taking place i.e. using Uniswap or another exchange. 
  - This has not been submitted to the governance forum but has been discussed in hopes of receiving a temperature check from the Uniswap community.
	
- Seeking $1 million to dedicate to the Bed Index
- Proposed as a diversification tool
- The average user can interact with the Bed Index protocol through Uniswap and Sushiswap

*Response: It may be a good idea for some diversification but Uniswap token is solely used for governance at this time*
  - Are you working on other interesting projects? 
  - Launched the vegan bot but it was replaced with better version
  - Bounty Board created, Writers Guild created through Bankless
  - Potentially creating a dao punk to auction off and show-case individual daoism

	
*2nd topic presented by Miller from the [DeFi Education Fund](https://www.defieducationfund.org/)*
	

- This proposal was to move education funds to a custodial wallet rather than using a multi-sig
  - The intent behind the proposal was to introduce education around policy making around cryptocurrency
  - Try to advance defi interests in policy making around the world
  - Discussing the snapshot proposal
  - The proposal didn’t pass
  - The primary concern was that the funds might be lost

- Miller is working on a few different projects
  - Discussed new SEC chair member Gensler and their approach to policy making
  - FATF “Financial Action Task Force” coming out with education documentation soon 
  - Discussion of social behavior: **Camp #1** imposing policy on defi and **Camp #2** doing it in a way where the benefits of defi can be realized in the present and in the future

  - Hosting defi education meetings with nearly all US state representatives
  - Funded some polling to see what the average voter thinks about Defi and are receiving interesting outcomes. Some of the results are available on the Defi Education Fund twitter
- Promising results from Blacksage on emails between members of European government
  - Conversation will be published 
  - 14 day return policy, familiar to Europeans, would have to be a part of hypothetical government policy
  - Government is narrowly thinking about defi in terms of tax evasion
  - Encouraging users to reach out to their local representatives to speak positively and educate legislators on defi
	
*3rd topic presented by Ben from [Ethelo](https://ethelo.com/)*

**Tooling for DAOs**
- Web2 digital democracy platform
  - Grant proposal would be take the Ethelo tool broadly available to the governance space
  - Company works mostly governance and some non-profits
  - Used for online decision making (policy discussion, grant allocation, infrastructure decisions, etc
  - Example, https://bestpicknft.ethelo.net/
  - Looking for support to build the platform as useable Web3 tool
  - Being able to sign in with Metamask to help with decision making in a lot different ways
  - "Cultivate the team members who understand the value of digital democracy"

*Questions*
	
- How does the product fit with Uniswap Governance?
  - Making sure there can be fairness with setting different weights to votes
  - A variety of measures can be applied to create a more fair voting system
  - All depends on the decision your looking to make
  - For example, you could have a sophisticated variety of criteria set to approve grants
  - Possibly useful for discussions, elections, ideation phase, etc.

- Discussing how Uniswap voting system 2.0 worked compared to ethelo
  - Ethelo’s algorithm can be used similarly but does so differently on the back end
  - Emphasis on the customization and configurations that work towards meeting goals
  - Solves a relevant problem within the governance space
  - Offers a community a way to modify the voting process in secure environment
  - This proposal did not pass

## Summary

- Support for the Bed Index, a part of the Bankless DAO, was presented Airbayer

- Miller from the DeFi Education fund discussed a rejected proposal to move education funds from a multi sig wallet to a custodial wallet for security purposes
	
- Ethelo was presented by Ben to showcase an existing sophisticated tool that enhances governance decision making in variety of different
