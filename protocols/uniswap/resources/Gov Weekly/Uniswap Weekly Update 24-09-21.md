### <p align="center"> *New Weekly Update for Uniswap from Mark Priddy - September 24th 2021*

# Call Notes

- Uniswap wants to attract liquidity providers

- To keep Uniswap competitive it needs better incentives and community engagement with governance

- 30 - 40% of Uniswap’s trading volume is in stablecoins USDC and USDT

- Concentrated liquidity is very important for stablecoin token pairs on Uniswap

- Uniswap seeks to be more competitive with Curve and Dodo with a possible lower fee tier
  - this is the only difference in why aggregators route transactions through these services

# Discussion Notes

- The community call is an opportunity to improve Uniswap with new ideas

- Ultimately, the market will decide but Uniswap will make it easier to provide liquidity on L2

- Possibly adjusting concentrated liquidity fees in the future to attract liquidity providers but not at this time (3 - 4 tiers of concentrated liquidity on L2)

- Aggregators would route more traffic through Uniswap with better fees

- Uniswap seeks to attract large traders who are using centralized exchanges

- Uniswap is seeking to double their market share of stablecoin trading

- Slippage may not be a factor but will be monitored if there is growing difference between Uniswap and other exchanges

- To start a proposal a user needs to have 2.5m UNI

# Summary

- Uniswap governance is an altruistic effort. Proposals are to purely make Uniswap better

- Average users can’t vote on proposals

- Good ideas are welcome and the community is encouraged to bring them forward

- Encouraging more liquidity providers migrate to L2 but there are no extra incentives at this time

- Noticing significant arbitrage opportunities between exchanges on L2 when trading at very large volumes
	
- Alex Kroeger and Getty Hill discussion to add a 1 basis point fee option to V3 factory pool [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-adding-1-basis-point-fee-pools-in-v3/14216)

- Liquidity is growing on Uniswap L2
