# Cabin
## Overview

### What is Cabin?
We believe that the next wave of economic activity is the Creator Economy. Economic waves consolidate into a single place, like traditional finance in New York City and tech in San Francisco. The Creator Economy will consolidate into Cabin, a decentralized city by and for creators.
- Therefore, our aim as a DAO is threefold:
	- Build a decentralized city with nodes all over the world
	- Empower creators to pursue an independent career online
	- Build the products for creators and DAOs to achieve the first two goals
There's so much more we could tell you, but we'll leave it at the short version for now. Read on to get more acquainted and if you want to come back and dive deeper, bookmark our #Cabin 2022 Roadmap for later reading or head over to https://creators.mirror.xyz/ to slide down the rabbit hole of endless articles from our writers.
### The Lay of the Land

As a decentralized city we have both physical and digital land. Our physical land is made up of our various nodes around the world. Our digital land is made up of the Discord server and our corner of Twitter. 
#### Physical Land

As of the time of writing, Cabin maintains two properties in the Texas Hill Country about 1 hour West of Austin. The first property is owned by @jon and leased to the DAO. The second property was recently acquired by a DAO member with plans to develop it into a full Cabin node.

We're currently in talks with six other groups about becoming nodes of the decentralized city. We also have multiple DAO members exploring the option of starting a node themselves.
If you're interested in starting a node, joining a node, or otherwise chatting about our physical presence, then head over to the 🌐new-nodes channel in the Placemaker's Guild in our Discord server. 

#### Digital Land
In addition to the various physical spaces we maintain, we also interact as a DAO through Discord and Twitter.
- You can follow the DAO on Twitter at @creatorcabins.
Like most DAOs, most of the interaction happens on our Discord server. Here are a couple of channels worth checking out after you finished your onboarding process (check out #01-welcome to cabin for that):
- 04-help - use this channel to ask any and all questions you have about the DAO or the community
- 🏛️CITY HALL - this section contains channels for DAO wide announcements, governance proposals, channels for ideas and also these channels:
