# Unslashed

Unslashed Finance offers coverage for a wide range of products, markets, and protocols. This coverage and protection is purchased by the user and is insured through other protocol participants that supply the capital.

## Overview

Unslashed is a decentralized insurance protocol covering all common risks for crypto assets. Unslashed enables almost instant liquidity to insurance buyers and risk underwriters, ensures constant collateralization, and guarantees transparency through an unbiased claims process. By tokenizing coverage and using “money streaming,” it allows maximum flexibility and freedom: the insured pay as they go and can instantly stop the policy to offload it at any time.

## Governance

Unslashed adopts a Compound-style governance system, which is becoming the standard for DAO-centric projects. The system consists of basic contracts, is easy to reason about, and has been very closely audited.

Several governance venues are available to Unslashed governance, each serving its own particular purpose. These processes are subject to change according to feedback from the Unslashed community.

1. Initial idea - Discord #governance
A Discord channel for governance-related discussion, where any community member is encouraged to post a draft for initial reaction feedback.

2. Discussion - Discourse
A Discourse-hosted forum for governance-related discussion. Community members must register for an account before sharing or liking posts. Following the comments the initial draft gathered, you can refine and update your proposal.

3. Final Vote - Tally
Tally is a friendly user-interface for the governance smart-contracts, it empowers user owned governance through a voting dashboard, governance tooling and real time research and analysis. The app can be used to review data on governance systems, active and past proposals, and individual delegates or token holders. The app also supports direct voting and vote delegation, helping users put their governance insights into action.
