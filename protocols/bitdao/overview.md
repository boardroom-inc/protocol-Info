**[BitDAO](https://www.bitdao.io/) believes DAOs can do more for industries like Art, Education, Media, Finance, Gaming, and Technology. And it's using its billions in existing assets and forecasted contributions to connect and empower the builders of the decentralized economy.**

Anyone can make a proposal to BitDAO and, through the governance process, BIT token holders determine the actions and direction of the organization. Since it infuses capital agnostically across industries, chains, and products, there's a great degree of flexibility in how its treasury is allocated.

## An Accelerator for Autonomous Entities
Autonomous Entities (AEs) are independent organizations that are funded from successful proposals to the BitDAO treasury and are focused on a particular product, use case, or industry. Examples of previously approved Autonomous Entities include [Game7](https://game7.io/), [zkDAO](https://zkdao.io/), and [EduDAO](https://edudao.io/).

# **Governance Process**
BitDAO is owned and governed by $BIT token holders. To reduce spam, 200k BIT is required to make a proposal and 100M BIT is required to approve it.

## Phase 1: Soft Proposal
In the Soft Proposal phase, proposals receive feedback from stakeholders in an open and informal way. This allows the proposer/proposers to make any necessary changes before an official proposal is made. The Soft Proposal phase occurs on [BitDAO's Discourse](https://discourse.bitdao.io/).

## Phase 2: Snapshot Vote
Once community feedback has been incorporated, the proposer may put the official proposal up for a vote on [BitDAO Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth). This is the final step in the governance process.
