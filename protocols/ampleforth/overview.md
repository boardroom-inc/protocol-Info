AMPL is the first rebasing currency of DeFi. It is an uncollateralized financial primitive with an elastic supply that adjusts each day according to demand in the marketplace. AMPL targets the 2019 USD. Like Bitcoin, AMPL is non-dilutive but it has a long-term unit of account that unlocks safe denomination in contracts, like debt.

Although not a stablecoin itself, AMPL can fulfill many of the same roles of a stablecoin without the associated risks. AMPL does not rely on centralized custodians, liquidation markets, or lenders of last resort. Thus AMPL is "durable" like Bitcoin. The goal of Ampleforth is to create a building block for a safer, more resilient financial ecosystem.
