# Ampleforth

## Overview

The Ampleforth protocol is a set of instructions on the Ethereum blockchain that produces a decentralized [unit of account](https://docs.ampleforth.org/learn/glossary#unit-of-account) called AMPL. The AMPL token is the primary building block of the Ampleforth Elastic Finance Ecosystem. It is used for lending & borrowing, for the creation of [derivatives](https://docs.ampleforth.org/learn/glossary#derivatives), and as collateral for a decentralized [stablecoin](https://docs.ampleforth.org/learn/glossary#stablecoin).

### Tokens
#### AMPL and FORTH
The protocol consists of two primary tokens, AMPL and FORTH.
- **AMPL**:  The unit of account ERC-20 token. AMPL's price targets the CPI adjusted 2019 USD, but the number of AMPL tokens in user wallets automatically increases or decreases based on demand. AMPL will deviate from its target when market demand indicates there is too much or too little supply, but the price per AMPL will always eventually return to its long-run target. 
- **FORTH**:  The Ampleforth ecosystem's [governance token](https://docs.ampleforth.org/learn/about-forth-governance). FORTH is an ERC-20 token used to govern protocol parameter changes, direct liquidity mining emissions, and direct the use of DAO treasury assets dedicated to stimulating innovations in the elastic finance and broader DeFi space. Holders vote using their FORTH tokens.  

## Ampleforth Governance
The Ampleforth protocol is governed through a series of sequential steps by holders of the $**FORTH** token, each representing increasing levels of consensus from the community. Proposals and ideas are surfaced on the [discord](https://discord.gg/mptQ49m) or our public [forum](https://forum.ampleforth.org/), and are finalized when they are deployed onchain. The progression of increasingly binding consensus can be seen below. Token contracts can be found on [github](https://github.com/ampleforth/Forth).

### Steps

#### Discussion
The highest level discussions may surface ideas in many places including (but not limited to) the #governance channel on discord, Governance Forum, social media, or community DAOs. When it appears that there is enough general support, a champion may formalize the idea by submitting an Ampleforth Improvement Proposal (AIP) or Configuration Change Proposal (ACCP). forum.ampleforth.org.
#### Proposals (AIPs / ACCPs)
AIPs and ACCPs are formal documents that describe the proposed change to the protocol or protocol configuration. aips.ampleforth.org.
#### Targeted Discussion
Each proposal has a dedicated forum topic where outcome-driven discussion takes place. The goal at this step is to finalize any unresolved issues and formalize offchain consensus. forum.ampleforth.org.
#### Off-chain Signaling
If the previous step did not arrive at obvious consensus, sentiment may be gathered in a non-binding way via off-chain signaling from token holders. This provides more insight into the likelihood of the outcome of the final binding vote by using actual voting power. signal.ampleforth.org
#### Technical Development
Requirements are implemented in code, launched on testnet, and audited for security.
#### Binding Vote / Deployment
The final step is a binding vote that happens onchain. The onchain vote is “binding” because its success results in execution of code, without intermediaries. This includes deploying new protocol contracts or modifying the state of existing ones. Members of the community may vote with their FORTH tokens directly or delegate to another address who many vote on their behalf. You can see proposals, delegate, and vote on the Tally dashboard.

## Ampleforth DAO

The Forth DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization dedicated to the growth of the Ampleforth ecosystem and the Ampleforth protocol as a financial building block. Holders of the FORTH token govern can participate in the direction of funds managed by the DAO. 

#### Overview
- The FORTH token has protocol-enforced maximum inflation of 2% per year
- New FORTH token emissions are controlled by the DAO
- Each year the FORTH token holders may vote to skip or or mint up to the full amount
- Proceeds from FORTH minting can be used as the DAO decides
#### Treasury
- The Forth DAO treasury is a protocol controlled wallet that holds DAO assets.
- To view AUM visit the [DAO dashboard](https://www.ampleforth.org/dashboard/dao)
- Forth DAO treasury wallet [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x223592a191ecfc7fdc38a9256c3bd96e771539a9)

#### Protocol Owned Liquidity
When a wallet deposits tokens into both sides of a liquidity pool on an automated market making platform (like Uniswap) it returns LP tokens to the depositor representing the wallet's share of the total liquidity pool and these LP tokens accrue trading fees to their holders.  

Protocol Owned Liquidity is the balance of LP tokens held in the FORTH DAO treasury. By participating in governance, FORTH token holders can direct the use of treasury assets to add or remove liquidity as they see fit. 
#### Ecosystem Grants
If the pending grants program proposal passes, holders of the FORTH token will also be able to vote on grants for teams and projects advancing the Ampleforth and broader elastic finance ecosystem.
