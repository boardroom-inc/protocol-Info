| SIP 123: Synthetix CurveDAO Governance Vault- XveCRV | Meta | [View](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-123) |

Summary:\
The synthetix XveCRV vault would enable the pDAO to vote on gauge weights and proposals at the discretion of the Ambassadors / Council

Synthetix is highly integrated with Curve.fi with significant synth liquidity in their various pools. Currently there is no strategy for voting for the gauge weights of any synth pools.
With veCRV being non-transferable / non-delegate-able , its being proposed Synthetix offers a vault that perpetually vote-locks CRV in return for veCRV fees.
