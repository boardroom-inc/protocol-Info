### <p align="center"> *New Weekly Update for Synthetix from Mark Priddy September 27th 2021 - October 1st 2021*

## Discord Announcement

[Last Week’s Weekly Recap Blog](https://snxweave.medium.com/snxweave-weekly-recap-3bfaa7ab3d81)

[On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4GqOLzoZtEXlQO0jN25oNW)

- The Mirfak release was completed and Wezen went out this week.

- All low-volume and inverse synths have officially been deprecated on L1.






## Governance

- There is an existing call on all $TOKE holders and TokenReactor community members to vote or show support for $SNX's inclusion in the upcoming Collateralization of Reactors Event.

- Voting begins on September 28th and will last for 7 days.

- Twitter Announcement - [Here's what this means for Synthetix](https://twitter.com/snxambassadors/status/1442539626724409357?s=20)

- Read more about the Tokemark Collateralization Event [here](https://medium.com/tokemak/c-o-r-e-collateralization-of-reactors-event-2a2d5b2f8e70)

- [Voting for the next Synthetix Governing Bodies](https://staking.synthetix.io/gov) expired EOD Wednesday 9.29.21

- SIP - 185 and 184 were presented to Synthetix Community Governance. [Recording here](https://anchor.fm/synthetix/episodes/SD029---SIPs-184--185-e181hfk)

  - SIP - 184 would introduce a dynamic fee that increases to neutralize frontrunning opportunities during market turbulence, then rapidly decays back to zero as prices stabilize.
  
  - SIP - 185 proposes moving away from using a debt ledger and the implementation of a debt shares token mechanism that allows the percentage of a staker’s debt to be calculated based on their number of shares. A staker’s percentage of the debt pool is their balance of debt shares divided by the total supply of all outstanding debt shares. Minting and burning sUSD debt updates the balance of debt shares issued.
  

## Summary

- Two SIPs were presented and discussed this week

- As part of Cycle Zero of the Tokemak launch, there will be a one week voting period to select 5 out of a whitelist of 36 protocols in the Collateralization of Reactors Event.

- 36 established projects are eligible to be voted in for the Reactor Event and Synthetix is one of them.

#### - Tokemak is designed to be primarily used by:
 - **Liquidity providers and yield farmers**: any user can deposit single assets into the network to be utilized as liquidity
 
 - **DAOs**: DAOs can harness Tokmak's liquidity flow in order to strengthen and direct liquidity for their project, offering an alternative to traditional liquidity mining
 
 - **New DeFi project**: New projects will be able to inexpensively stand up their own token reactors and use the Tokemak's protocol controlled assets to generate healthy liquidity for their project from its inception
 
 - **Market Makers**: MMs can take advantage of the network's store of assets in order to direct liquidity across various exchanges

 - **Exchanges**: exchanges can also leverage TOKE's utility in order to gain access to deep liquidity to bolster their market depth
