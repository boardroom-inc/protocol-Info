- Release of [Dynamic Exchange Fees](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-184) needs to be audited but should be out within a few weeks
	
- [SIP-80](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-80/) will be on Mainnet L2 soon. 
  - It will be a beta version because the max open interest is going to be kept constrained early
	
  - Dynamic Fees will need to be ready in order to mitigate frontrunning risk before the full version of Futures is rolled out
	
  - "There will be two fee tiers: next price fulfillment that creates a lower-fee tier for arbitragers, and the usual atomic exchanges for a higher fee."[^1]
