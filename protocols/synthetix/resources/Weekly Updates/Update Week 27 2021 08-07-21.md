| SIP 156: Chainlink Debt Pool Oracle | Product/Oracle | [View](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-156) |

Summary:\
This SIP proposes to replace the existing debt cache mechanism with a debt pool oracle operated by Chainlink. The current debt cache mechanism has the benefit of being entirely on-chain, however, it introduces significant complexity to the protocol. By replacing it with a Chainlink oracle we will simplify many functions within Synthetix and reduce gas costs, as well as introducing more scalability to the number of Synths the protocol can support.
