## Governance

### Spartan Council and Core Contributor Committee

- [SIP - 182](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-182/) almost completed but will likely be released after regenesis.

- [SIP - 80](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-80/) for Futures is progressing well. The goal is to have it ready after the regenesis.	

- [SIP - 187](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-187/) completed
> "During his presentation, Jackson explained that the partial updates in the debt cache aren’t being updated properly when minting and burning sUSD. However now, with [SIP - 187](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-187/), when minting and burning sUSD, the debt cash and the total debt value of the system are updated right away, and don’t require a debt snapshot to happen first. This fix will be applied on L1 and L2, and actually slightly reduces the minting and burning costs in the process. This SIP is currently being voted on."[^1]

- Moving forward there will be clearer differentiation between Synthetix as an infrastructure provider and Kwenta as a dApp developer
  - Working on blog post to detail the specifics of this change 
	
- For Spartan Council updates, Kain suggested creating a project management tool for everyone to use.
- Kain will be putting this together and will serve to more clearly iterate and details their goals and expectations for the epoch.

### GrantsDAO

- Version 2 of the SIP/SCCP site revamp was completed	
	
- A flashloan tool is in the works for SNX stakers
  - Stakers in danger of liquidation may use this tool to fix their C-ratio without the liquidation penalty, and potentially with less market impact
  - Users may desire to sell some of their SNX in order to pay off their remaining debt
	
- GrantsDAO or gDAO working on an updated Synthetix Staking Guide
  - It will be focused more towards the everyday user
  - Detailed introduction to staking, derivatives, C-ratio management, debt hedging, and more
	
- SNXweave is expanding coverage with the help of the gDAO.
	
### AmbassadorsDAO
	
- [Governance Participation Program](https://synthetixembassy.io/blog/613eb094be6aa4003ec2b7b3) ended last week
  - With the amount of UNI that was delegated, this program was a great success in encouraging governance participation

- Upcoming **"Spartan City Halls"** events will allow other communities to present their projects and ideas to the Spartan Community
  - Hosted in Discord
	
- Similar to the tool Kain will create, the Ambassadors DAO is working on publishing a roadmap blog post for the next 3 months
	
- [SIP - 161](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-161/) to establish a Core Contributor Committee
  - Three members who are responsible for duties such as managing the Core Contributor roadmap, deciding their payment and performance reviews, and interfacing with the Spartan Council to help decide the prioritization of SIPs
	
- [SIP - 172](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-172/) aims to simplify meta-governance processes of the Synthetix Governance System.
  - redefines the different types of governing bodies within Synthetix, including the difference between the roles and responsibilities of a Council versus a Committee
  - If approved, each of these governing bodies will now fall under the umbrella term of “Synthetix DAOs.” 
	
**New Names of Synthetix Councils**
	
1. Spartan Council
2. Treasury Council
3. Grants Council
4. Ambassador Council
5. Core Contributor Committee
6. Risk Committee
	

- The Risk Committee, proposed by [SIP - 186](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-186/) would consist of five members who would be responsible for analysis of risk within the Synthetix Protocol, carrying out the risk analysis to be introduced in the SIP life-cycle, and providing risk analysis summaries for the Spartan Council to take into consideration when debating and voting on SIPs
  - Currently discussing a possible trial period for the Committee as well as reducing the number of committee members and adjusting the time period epochs for committee positions 

## Summary
	
- Sargas release with shorting feature now available on mainnet	

- Atomic Exchange Fucntion efficiency improved by Kaleb and Afif
	
- Spartan Council/Core Contributor Committee and Grants DAO have projects in the works to better serve the Synthetix team and improve productivity and in addition educations for the everyday user

- SIP 80, 182 still in progress. The Kaus release has been completed and released to L1 and L2.   
	
- Per [SIP - 186](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-186/) have the Risk committee members selected by the other governing bodies, rather than selected from within them.

- Per [SIP-187](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-187/) The Kaus release has been completed and released to L1 and L2.   	

## Additional Research

- Synthetix subtweet showing for Synthetix from [@gatheringgwei](https://twitter.com/GatheringGwei/status/1436433176285483008)
	
- October 20th: There was an issue with inflation minting for last snapshot which caused SNX staking rewards to be lower on both L1 and L2. Core Contributors are looking into it and will announce a mitigation plan once its panned out
