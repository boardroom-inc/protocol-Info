## Summary

New Weekly Update for Synthetix from Mark Priddy September 6th 2021 - September 16th 2021

SDAO - Treasury council being established

Core contributor proposal is still being drafted - significant internal progress has been made on this

SIP 180 - Proposal to establish the Aelin protocol - proposed this past week - waiting for additional feedback - aiming to have it presented soon

Aelin is an open and permissionless set of factory contracts that allows anyone to substantiate a pool of capital that can be used to source deals within the Ethereum ecosystem

This synth aims to leverage the decentralized governance framework of Synthetix in order to transparently launch this new protocol

If approved, SNX stakers will receive a portion of Aelin tokens as a sign of appreciation for the effort that has gone into Synthetix governance enablish Aelin to launch

Futures are main focus for the core contributors - Testing for Synthetix futures is going well

The first alpha phase that's been deployed on Coven OVM is really helping with internal testing and making sure that things like the liquidation mechanism work as intended

They are looking to improve the funding rate model and the dev team has been doing some R&D with crypto ecommerce to update the model for the futures funding rate

Once the dapp is improved, and once any possible issues are fixed, the plan is to have an initial incentivized testnet open to the public on Coven OVM.
This synth is still in feasibility for now.

SIP 171 - Proposal to allow transfers of non-fee reclamation balances. In contact with Andre Cronje as they clarify and finalize a few elements. Hopes are to present it next week.

Since the Atomic exchange functions approval last week, Contract addresses have been added to the synth. However, the council deemed these changes minimal and not significant enough to require an additional vote.

SIP 120 is now in audit so we should hear some more progress towards development soon.

SIP 135 is approved as well for L2 Shorting. This is being audited right now and hopefully there will not be any contract changes necessary depending on the feedback received from the audit. This is just being cleaned up a bit in hopes of getting it primed for release in the next couple of weeks.

Working with the Kwenta team on the front end integration for L2. 
SIP 179 - Proposal that Kwenta becomes an independent protocol presented to the council this week. This would formally enable Kwenta to have it’s own governance system, it’s own token, and it’s own community framework. The motivation behind this SIP is to enable the synthetics trading experience to move beyond a simple front end for Synthetix. 

Up until now, Kwenta has been managed from within by the Synthetix core contributors which is more of an infrastructure provider rather than a customer facing product. The transition to move to a fully independent project will enable Kwenta to drive it’s own community governance while also getting the focus it needs to produce a product that meets user demand. If approved, there will be two follow up SIP(s) (177 and 178) which will involve an open ballot box where anyone in the community can sign up to become an interim council member or Kwenta treasure DAO member. The Spartan council will then choose the most qualified candidates from that list. 

Hoping to have this list up within a week of SIP - 179 being approved, during which time the ballot box will be created for anyone to nominate themselves. An interim council member will not be restricted from running again for the first proper council. 

At the end of the presentation, it was stated that development would like to see the amount of Quinta tokens that will be distributed to current SNX stakers explicitly specified in the proposal before voting on this SIP. This is still being decided

SIP - 174 paves the way for synths to be deprecated
