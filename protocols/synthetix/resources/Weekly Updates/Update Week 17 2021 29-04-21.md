| SIP 133: Add DOGE as Crypto Synth  | Product | [View](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-133) |

Summary:\
Dogecoin has risen to a top 10 spot in the crypto market, and now boasts very high volume on centralized exchanges, in the multi-billions per day on average. With an sDOGE synth, Synthetix can capture a sizeable share of that market, generating more fees for the Synthetix protocol. The synth would pair nicely with renDOGE, a 1:1 Dogecoin token on Ethereum backed 1:1 by the Ren project, enabling highly liquid cross-pool synth swaps.
