## Governance

### Spartan Council and Core Contributor Committee

- [SIP-184](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-184): Adds a dynamic fee in addition to base exchange fees that responds to and neutralizes oracle frontrunning opportunities.
	
  - "Afif agreed that if SIP-184 isn’t ready in time for the next test-net competition, then there should be a keeper ready to use. Or else, perhaps it would just be better to wait to do the next competition until 184 is ready. For this reason, the Council is examining whether or not it’s feasible for the Dynamic Exchange Fees SIP to be accelerated."[^1]

- [Futures](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-80/) feature is almost ready and there will be another test-net competition after the regenesis, and then all of the parameters should be finalized for Futures to go up on Mainnet.
	
- [Debt Pool Oracle](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-156) progressing but a discussion needs to happen with Chainlink to move this SIP forward.
	
- A new proposal will come out soon that will provide augmentation for the wrappr factory on L1
	
- [Debt Pool Unification](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-165) and [Debt Shares](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-185) should be implemented by the end of the year.
	
  - A discussion still needs to take place around what the debt pool unification will look like.
	
  - Once the other two SIPs are completed, it will open up the possibility of finally unifying the debt pool.
	
	
### GrantsDAO

- the team has been exploring possible ideas to incentivize stakers to migrate over to L2 from L1
	
- gDAO NFT project news should be coming out soon as collaborations with Universe and ARCx progress
	
- New gDAO site pull request officially submitted
	
- Heroku integration for the hedging bot is also almost complete.
	
- [The gDAO is looking to hire a smart contract developer](https://medium.com/@SynthetixGrants/buy-snx-to-fix-c-ratio-dapp-bd8bd351205f) to create a smart contract tool that enables Synthetix stakers to fix their c-ratio by buying SNX.  
  - Submit a grant proposal [here](https://grants.synthetix.io/grants/grant-application)
	
- The 300 group looking for new ways to engage with Synthetix Community to start unique discussions and build unique perspectives.
