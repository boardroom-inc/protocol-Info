# Governance

[SNXweave Weekly Recap Notes - Friday 9.17.21](https://snxweave.medium.com/snxweave-weekly-recap-29daeae82d7)

### Four SIPs were presented this week

SIP - 181, presented by Afif, proposes Simulated Liquidity for Synthetix Exchanges. This would include the implementation of a synthetic pricing curve with parametric liquidity constants to increase the cost of very large trades through Synthetix while still giving users the best price execution.

SIP - 182, presented by Mark and Daniel, proposes Wrappr Factory which would be to allow new Wrappr contracts to be deployed that can support virtually any ERC-20 token. This would behave just like the ETH Wrappr from SIP - 112. In addition, a new abstract factory contract was proposed that can deploy new wrappers as needed, rather than creating another distinct SIP and contract for each new token to be added in the future.

SIP - 177 and SIP - 178 are the last two SIPs required for the Kwenta integration. SIP - 179 was approved last week. SIP - 177 and 178 will formalize the Kwenta TreasuryDAO and the Kwenta Interim Council.

SCCP - 138 was approved this week to further Reduce the L2 Target C-Ration to 600%. This will help bring needed sUSD liquidity to Optimism.

Internal testing for Synthetic Futures (SIP - 80)  ongoing with test net going.

Jackson is working on a way to open the test net to the public and working on the funding rate mechanism. The possible plan is to have Kwenta team pick up Futures dApp to help make improvements so that the test net can be opened up for public trading.
