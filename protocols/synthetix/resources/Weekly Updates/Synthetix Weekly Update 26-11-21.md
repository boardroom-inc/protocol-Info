## Governance

### Spartan Council and Core Contributor Committee

- [Futures](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-80/) per SIP-80 
  - The Council recognizes that there hasn't been a lot of new information on this SIP but Dynamic Exchange Fees needs to be audited and next price fee fulfillment is necessary for it's release.	
- Most likely will not have another testnet competition as long as they can test Dynamic Fees on testnet internally

- In regards to the next price fulfillment, Core Contributor Arthur has been reworking some of the logic from the old code. 
  - There will also be built-in slippage protection, so orders won’t go through if the price moves too much
	
- Once these SIPs are completed, the team will be moving into phase 2 of the v2x roadmap
	
- [SIP-146](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-301/) and [SIP-181](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-303/) have been reorganized to be a part of the v3 roadmap but were originally a part of phase 2. 146 is now 301 and 181 is now 303 in order to get as much of the v2x completed before the new year.
  
  - "Kain will be writing up a debt synthesis overview, which will detail the various components of the debt pool merge, what the sequence of events will be, etc. so that everyone is familiar with what the process will look like, which SIPs are being implemented, and how it will happen." [^1]

- The Debt Migration contract will allow migration of debt position without requiring you to burn debt but this SIP hasn't been created
  
  - This SIP will allow you to move a synth from L1 to L2

- New [SIP-189](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-189/) was presented by Kaleb to the Spartan Council and was approved

	
### GrantsDAO

- [Retroactive Public Goods](https://medium.com/@SynthetixGrants/the-synthetix-grantsdao-retroactive-public-goods-grants-program-629ec299c4d4) Grants initiative starts December 1st.
	
- The gDAO will be releasing a PDF that details the eligibility criteria for public good projects to be invited to this private side round of grant funding that will take place as part of Gitcoin Grants’ round 12
	
  - It will be up to the community to decide how to allocate the $50,000 of Synthetix Grants funding
	
  - The funding will be completed in two parts
	
- Tools.Synthetix is also coming along well
	
- Mike has been working on some dune analytics on Synthetix stakers with Core Contributor db
	
  - This includes staking sizes, number of stakers, duration, reward claiming regularity, etc
	
	
### AmbassadorsDAO

- Third Spartan City Hall with Aelin Protocol [recording here](https://anchor.fm/synthetix/episodes/SD036---Spartan-City-Hall-3---Aelin-e1af7f3)
	
  - Aelin is an open and permissionless set of factory contracts that enables anyone to instantiate a pool of capital that can be used to source deals within the Ethereum ecosystem
