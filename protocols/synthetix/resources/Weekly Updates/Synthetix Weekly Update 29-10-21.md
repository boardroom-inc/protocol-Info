## Governance

### Spartan Council and Core Contributor Committee

- [SIP-187](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-187/) to fix partial synth updates in debt cache was approved last week, with all eight Council members voting in favor
  - This SIP should alleviate the problem that occurs when a large holder burns and the debt snapshot isnâ€™t completed
	
- The Wrappr Factory [SIP-182](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-182/) was implemented Thursday October 28th 	
  - Proposed a new abstract factory contract that can deploy new wrappers as needed, rather than creating another distinct SIP and contract for each new token to be added in the future	
  - It will be starting with ETH and LINK, and then each new Wrappr instance can be introduced to the factory via a SIP
	
- [SIP-80](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-80/) for Futures still progressing as well while Kwenta team performs final tests

- [SCCP-142](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-142/) discussed which will increase L2 inflationary rewards from 50k to 75k SNX weekly
  - Is is likely council will wait to vote on this SCCP until after the Wrappr Factory SIP is implemented

- Full V2X roadmap again [here](https://blog.synthetix.io/v2x-revisited/)

- Risk Committee [SIP-186](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-186/) needs to be revised and, "should be stripped down to a simple proposal that allows the Core Contributors to organize and vote their own representatives into the Committee." [^1]

- [SIP-172](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-172/) and [SIP-161](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-161/) not finalized

### GrantsDAO

- The Treasury Council just distributed $32k sUSD to the gDAO for their short-term budget
  - One of the grantDAOâ€™s projects is a [debt hedging bot](https://medium.com/@SynthetixGrants/synthetix-debt-hedging-bot-458fca8b0f4b) that stakers can use to automatically hedge their debt externally
  - There has been some brainstorming around how to make it a little more user friendly
	
- Still working on The 300 article to enhance community participation and share ideas
 
- [Teleportr](https://medium.com/@SynthetixGrants/teleport-eth-to-optimism-with-teleportr-f6b1b719736c) was temporarily down last week as it was labeled as a phishing site by a small number of people, which led to it immediately being taken down by a centralized service
  - Proves the need for decentralized hosting services
  - [Tweet from Clem](https://twitter.com/0x_clem/status/1451169510476627975?s=20) with more information about the issue

- GrantsDAO is also still working on version 1.5 of the gDAO site
  - CT met with the coder to request an update to the grant application page for it to include multiple input fields, as well as a gDAO initiative page	

- NFT project on the horizon
  - Partnering with ARCx and Universe. They are actively working to make this project
	
### AmbassadorsDAO

- The Ambassador DAO hosted a Town Hall with some members of the Lyra Team/Council Thursday October 28th
- Topics of conversation included: 
  - Lyra Governance
  - synergies between Synthetix & Lyra
  - Options trading 
  - Lyra/SNX Liquidity incentives on L2 
  - Community had an opportunity for an open question period with Lyra team

- [SIP - 172](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-172/) seeks to simplify the meta-governance processes of the Synthetix Governance System and addresses current meta-governance edge-cases and frictions
- This SIP would also formalize the names of the following councils:

**New Names of Synthetix Councils**
	
1. Spartan Council
2. Treasury Council
3. Grants Council
4. Ambassador Council
5. Core Contributor Committee
6. Risk Committee

- The first Spartan City Hall is happening soon and will take place in the public Synthetix Stage in [Discord](https://discord.gg/bq3V9brMQV)
