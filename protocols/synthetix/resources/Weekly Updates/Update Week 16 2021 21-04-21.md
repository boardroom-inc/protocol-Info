Summary:  
SIP-124. The protocolDAO is one of the most critical governing bodies within the Synthetix protocol, however, the current process for assigning a new member to the protocolDAO is fairly informal and at the discretion of the other pDAO members. This worked well historically, but as the governance of Synthetix has progressively decentralised a more formal and transparent process for assigning members to the pDAO is required.
