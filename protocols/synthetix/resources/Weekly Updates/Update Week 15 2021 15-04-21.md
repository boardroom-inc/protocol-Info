| SIP 129: sSNX ERC-20 Synths | Product | [View](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-129) |

Summary:\
Curve cross-asset swaps along with SIP 120 allow for atomic cross-asset swaps. Even without SIP 120 it is important to capture all high volume pairs as synths for synthetix exchange volume. @kaiynne has identified high volume assets in PR 407. I propose to add sSNX as another key addition.
