## What is Kleros?

Kleros is a decentralized dispute resolution protocol for use on smart contract platforms, which has been implemented on Ethereum. It acts as a decentralized third party capable of providing decisions on the correct result when applying a set of rules to questions ranging from simple to highly complex.

This is achieved by using game-theoretic incentives to have crowdsourced jurors analyze and rule on cases correctly. Hence, Kleros provides judgments in an inexpensive, reliable, typically fast, and decentralized way. Of particular relevance is the use of this protocol to dispute resolution, creating a form of decentralized justice.

## Kleros PNK Token

Kleros PNK token enables the creation of the right incentives and the prevention of Sybil attacks. Kleros needs its own token as a defense against 51% attacks. This token gives users the ability to be selected as jurors. As such, users should have an interest in holding PNK tokens because of the opportunity that these tokens represent to receive fees and rewards for coherence for arbitrating disputes.

PNK is used both to stake (for the possibility to become a juror and to protect against attacks) and in the governance (voting rights) when new proposals, courts, or other parameters are suggested throughout our Dapps.

- **Voting Rights**: PNK is used for all governance decisions taken on the Kleros platform. Users can vote with their PNK in any related votes. We already use this mechanism in our token curated list and court governance decisions. 
- **Staking Rewards**: Users must stake PNK in order to be able to become jurors in disputes. The more PNK a user stakes, the more chance he has of being chosen as a juror in the selected court.



## Governance

The Kleros Protocol is fully decentralized and autonomous. Here is how to participate in its governance. Anyone can propose changes to core contracts powering the Kleros ecosystem and all these changes need to be voted on and executed via community vote using PNK.

The Kleros Protocol Governance process consists of the decision-making and enforcement process for the different changes in parameters, contract deployments, policy specifications, incentives, and improvements that make up the Kleros protocol. Future decisions governing the protocol will be enacted through this procedure. The PNK token empowers holders with the capability to vote on proposals and collectively act as governors of the protocol.

#### Steps of a successful Kleros Improvement Proposal:

1. Create a KIP (Kleros Improvement Proposal) post in the "Votes" section of the Kleros Forum.
2. Receive community feedback and update the KIP until it can be considered non-contentious.
3. Publish a new proposal on Kleros Snapshot page to have the PNK token holders vote on it.
4. If the proposal is accepted, submit a list of transactions implementing the proposal(s) changes on Kleros Governor.
5. If no one successfully challenges this list, Kleros Governor enacts the changes by sending the transactions.
