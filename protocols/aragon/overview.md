## What is Aragon?

Aragon is a suite of applications and services that enable new forms of global communities.

Communities can organize around capital assets, currency, or tokens, which will increase in value as more people hold and use that asset to participate in the community.

By providing the tools for people to turn a community, cause, or even a meme into its own economy, we can unlock a long-tail of DAOs that are not limited just to protocols like Ethereum or Bitcoin.

Aragon not only provides basic financial tools like tokenization but can create reproducible and broadly applicable templates for defining the boundaries of a community and flowing value to contributors over the internet without traditional intermediaries.

But this isn't science fiction, it's happening now, and you can be a part of it.

## Why does Aragon exist?

The Aragon project was founded to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of organizations.

We believe everyone should have equal access to governance and collaboration, no matter their age, gender, or race.

The project was originally started by Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo in November 2016.
