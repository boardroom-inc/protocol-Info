## Overview
### What is C.R.E.A.M. Finance?
C.R.E.A.M. Finance is a decentralized lending protocol for individuals and protocols to access financial services. The protocol is permissionless, transparent, and non-custodial.
Currently, C.R.E.A.M. is live on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Fantom.

C.R.E.A.M. Finance’s smart contract money markets are focused on longtail assets -- with the goal of increasing capital efficiency for all assets in crypto markets.
Users are able to lend any supported assets on our markets, and use the provided capital as collateral to borrow another supported asset.

C.R.E.A.M. offers a wide range of tokens on our money markets, including: stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD); interest-bearing stablecoins (yCRV, yyCRV); defi tokens (YFI, SUSHI, CREAM, CREAM); LP-tokens (USDC-ETH SLP, WBTC-ETH SLP); and other cryptocurrencies (ETH, LINK). This list is not exhaustive.
Please check the link below for the latest list of supported tokens:
