## Overview

Spun out of the venerable [Seed Club](https://club.mirror.xyz/a5PQAwU0CuHJ90lEOmzq545nlC4qqNoTVTeHEGRrqow), mCLUB is a [new grant-giving DAO](https://club.mirror.xyz/dnN3Dwe-iD6jBpzkase4YLHTxYtnuFnmUbSoOfPEkjI). We focus on recruiting, backing, and supporting creators and communities onto the Mirror platform while offering learning experiences for those interested in creating and working within a DAO.

[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) is much more than a publishing platform for writers and artists. It’s a community-owned and -operated protocol with an ambitious, far-reaching, and creator-centered vision. Mirror provides powerful web3 infrastructure and tools that enable creators to unlock emergent financial and community value.

But how can this value be directed in ways that benefit more creators and their communities?

That’s where mCLUB comes in.

With the financial and social capital raised through our successful membership drive, we’re well-positioned to help creators, curators, and their communities learn and thrive within the Mirror ecosystem. We provide valuable hands-on experience to those seeking opportunities in DAOs.

In our initial launch, we attracted a community of 189 members who contributed over 47 ETH (about $107,000 at the time) and [inspired another new DAO](https://twitter.com/BlockchainatCU/status/1420102507334971395).
