# Autonolas
Create, run and own autonomous services that power next-gen apps for crypto users and DAOs
## Overview

### What is autonolas ?
As crypto attempts to “cross the chasm” into mainstream, real-world use-cases, a developer tooling problem continues to slow the pace of progress. Developers are stuck with either:

* potent, but limited smart contracts or
* rich, but centralized web services

This leaves

* end-users with applications that are either complex to use or too opaque to trust
* DAOs with bloated operations and applications which are far too complex for the average user

Autonolas aims to solve this problem by giving developers a cutting-edge set of tools. Our tools allow developers to build with the potency of smart contracts and the flexibility of traditional web programming. This will enable new applications, unlocking Web3 through better user experiences and giving DAOs more structured and efficient operations.

Using our tools, developers can build autonomous services. The table below orients autonomous services in relation to the other types of software we see in crypto:

As you can see, autonomous services combine the best of smart contracts, web services, and decentralized services. Learn more in Autonomous Services: Comparison.

Autonomous services are made up of agents, each of which is run by a separate operator. They run continuously, can pull in data from any source, and can perform sophisticated processing like machine learning. They are secured by and take action via our on-chain protocol across different chains. They can also take action via off-chain APIs. Learn more in Autonomous Services: How they Work.

To build autonomous services, developers make use of our open-source framework, Open Autonomy. They register their code on our on-chain protocol. Some developers will develop full services, others just develop smaller pieces of code. Other developers can then combine those smaller bits of code into full, running services. This is helped by the protocol’s tokenomics. Learn more in Developer Experience.

DAOs can then consume these services, either to improve how they work or to deliver better products and services. Autonomous services can help DAOs:

* manage their funds and make decisions more efficiently
* build robust products, with far more power

## Governance

Governance is particularly important in a modular system as it is used to vote on the adoption or abandoning of modes of functioning. Autonolas’ governance system is designed to assume various control points, such as launching and managing Agent Services (see the so-called [Protocol-owned Services]([https://twitter.com/autonolas/status/1504120575849074699?t=O2cRu-X8yVnqDFm_Qu8jNg&s=19) for more details), managing minting rules for contributed software components, and upgrading various parameters in the tokenomics.
 
Building on the experience of existing decentralized protocols, such as Compound, we created three distinct components for governance: the veOLAS virtualized-token (locked claim on OLAS), the GovernorOLAS governance module, and the Timelock. Together, these components will allow the community to propose, vote, and implement changes. Proposals can notably modify system parameters, support new technological directions, or add entirely new functionality to the protocol.

### OLAS token 
OLAS  utility token of Autonolas protocol that follows the ERC20 standard. Initially, OLAS can be used for locking to participate in governance. The purposes of OLAS increase when the other parts of the Autonolas protocol will be deployed. In particular, OLAS will allow the protocol to acquire assets, including their own liquidity, in exchange for OLAS tokens at a discount and, as a byproduct, will attract more developers in contributing to the protocol. 

### veOLAS
The name veOLAS stands for voting escrowed OLAS and it is built upon the experience of existing decentralized protocols, such as Curve finance. veOLAS is a non-tradeable virtualized token that can be obtained by locking OLAS. Users that want to participate in Autonolas governance are required to lock some of their OLAS tokens for a maximum of four years. veOLAS are used then to determine the voting power of an account and this voting power decays linearly as the remaining time of OLAS unlock decreases.

### The Governance process 
Autonolas DAO is made up of holders of veOLAS which have non-delegable voting power. Any address that holds at least 5000 veOLAS can create a governance proposal that can be voted upon by voters.
When a governance proposal is created, it enters a two days **review period**, after which voting begins. Voting lasts for three **election duration** days and any address with veOLAS can vote for or against or abstain the proposal.  If a majority and at least 3% of the global voting power are cast for the proposal, the latter is queued in the Timelock and can be implemented two days later.

Exceptionally, some changes to the Autonolas Protocol could be executed by a **community-owned multisig wallet**, bypassing the governance process. This allows a set of trusted actors to overrule governance in certain aspects, e.g. security exploits that need to be patched without governance discussion.
Off-chain governance
Optionally, the on-chain proposal stage can be preceded by an off-chain signaling vote, using the [Snapshot platform](https://snapshot.org/#/autonolas.eth). Off-chain signaling can be a good tool to gauge the interest of community participants with low willingness to pay for on-chain voting, who might otherwise be unable to express their preferences

## Join

Autonolas DAO will be made up of holders Autonolas DAO is made up of holders of veOLAS. To become a veOLAS holder, you can lock some of your OLAS tokens in the veOLAS contract [(veOLAS | Etherscan)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7e01A500805f8A52Fad229b3015AD130A332B7b3). veOLAS will represents your voting power in governance and will allows you to make fundamental decision  in governance, such us the distribution of OLAS inflation or the distribution of the protocol profits.
