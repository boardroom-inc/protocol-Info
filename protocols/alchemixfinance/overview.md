## Alchemix Finance

Alchemix Finance is a future-yield-backed synthetic asset platform and community DAO. The platform gives one advances on their yield farming via a synthetic token that represents a fungible claim on any underlying collateral in the Alchemix protocol. The DAO will focus on funding projects that will help the Alchemix ecosystem grow, as well as the greater Ethereum community.

### Components

**Vaults**

Vaults act as the hub to generating yield advances, and share many similarities to lending platforms such as MakerDAO and AAVE. The first collateral type that the protocol will accept is DAI.

**Transmuter**

The Transmuter allows users to stake their synthetic assets and have them be converted into their base asset over time.

**Token Distribution**

The Alchemix governance token (ALCX) will split among the developers, the DAO itself, and the community, with the vast majority going to the community.

**Alchemix DAO**

The governance of Alchemix Finance will be managed by a DAO with a liquid governance token, ALCX.
The Alchemix DAO will begin as a developer multisig with signaling through the Snapshot app. ALCX Tokens give holders governance rights over the direction of the protocol and use of the treasury. It will transition into a feature complete DAO.

## Purpose of the DAO

The Alchemix DAO will receive income from the Alchemix protocol, with a portion of the yield earned going into the treasury. The treasury will pay out developers and permanent staff to maintain and expand the protocol. In addition, treasury funds will pay for audits of the protocol and any of its future products.
The Alchemix DAO will fund projects that build on Alchemix or use the alchemical synthetic tokens in their applications. 

If the community likes your idea and approves it via a token vote, then you will receive funding.
Alchemix believes in supporting the greater Ethereum community and plans to donate a portion of treasury income to gitcoin grants and other charitable programs. 
Token holders can signal a desire to make changes to the protocol via governance voting. 

## Governance Process

In the community Discord, there will be a governance channel where people can discuss matters of the protocol and suggestions for how to modify it. Once a coherent action plan has been established, a community member will draft a formal proposal on the Alchemix forums. Each proposal requires a poll for a yes/no vote, and/or a selection of parameters it wants to change. If that poll receives majority support, then it will be put on Snapshot for an official community vote. From there, developers will do their due diligence and implement it if it is determined safe to do so.
