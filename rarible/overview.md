**Rarible is the first community-owned NFT marketplace**

Introduction
------------------

The ultimate goal of Rarible is to evolve into a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where all governance and decision rights belong to the platform users. Need a new feature? Have a vision how to make the platform better? Think someone is toxic and should be moderated? Or some members deserve an art or community grant? On Rarible, you have a voice, and your voice is heard.

We welcome the NFT community with active vision and attitude to participate in Rarible marketplace and build the fully decentralized marketplace of the future with us.

Governance Process
------------------

### 1) Come up with an idea. Promote it

Got an idea? Awesome --- now, go advocate! Initiate a discussion in [Rarible Discord](https://discord.gg/eqFx6c), in Telegram and Twitter. Convince other participants to support you, get them to express their voice & upvote. Hear feedback. Make sure that your proposal will make the platform better for everyone.

### 2) Create your proposal pitch in [Rarible Discussion](https://gov.rarible.com/)
