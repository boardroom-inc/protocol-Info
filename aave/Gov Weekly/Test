Allow users to vote with AAVE, stkAAVE and aAAVE. 11,8% of AAVE in total circulation are aAAVE and only 4,69% of circulating supply has been used to vote during AIP 07 (a record). 
Most of users use their AAVE as a collateral and they are at the moment excluded from the voting process.

| Introduce Liquidity Incentives for Aave v2 | Treasury | [View](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-introduce-liquidity-incentives-for-aave-v2/2340/25) |
Design liquidity mining (LM) program optimized for the long term growth of Aave. ParaFi proposes a distribution of 550 Staked AAVE per day, split 50-50 between lenders and borrowers of the most popular markets.
Generally, the community is strongly opposed to this proposition. LM seems useless and totally inefficient at this point.

| [ARC][POLL] Create AAVE governance badges | Product | [View](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-poll-create-aave-governance-badges/2404) |
Interactions on the forum feel impersonal and contributors are not rewarded for their investment. Introduceing “Badges” into the forum would gamify the governance experience.
Similar to a proof of attendance, badges are testimonials of different achievements user has done into the Aave ecosystem.
