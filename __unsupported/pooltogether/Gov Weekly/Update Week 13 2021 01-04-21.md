This [proposal](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-6-retry-attempt-at-ptip-3/773?u=brendan) is a repeat of [PTIP-3](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-3-add-pool-to-pool-prize-pool/745), as PTIP-3 failed to execute.\

(2) Use POOL from the treasury to fill a token faucet that drips POOL to the POOL pool ticket holders at 100 POOL per day.

| “The Fish Tank” / Fair win chances for little balances | Product | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/the-fish-tank-fair-win-chances-for-little-balances/627) |

Summary:\
This post addresses concern with whales winning most prizes.
It proposes a feature called "The Fish Tank", whereby a percentage of the interest is put aside to fill another prize pool, which is not correlated to the number of tickets, but only to the addresses who enter.

Update:
[Pushback](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/the-fish-tank-fair-win-chances-for-little-balances/627/6) given that the "PoolPower Pods" coming soon may well address this problem.

| Use Yearn vaults to generate a higher payout | Incentives/Product | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/use-yearn-vaults-to-generate-a-higher-payout/639) |

Summary:\
Suggestion to combine combine the [Fish Tank Idea](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/the-fish-tank-fair-win-chances-for-little-balances/627/6) with the Yearn Vaults to increase the payout amounts. The larger return on the pooled assets would offset any noticed losses on payouts due to the increased overall size of the payout

Update:
Work has begun on adding Yield Sources.
